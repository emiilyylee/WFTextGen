"I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern and seek immediate resolution regarding an unauthorized charge and the subsequent overdraft fee incurred on my account. 

On XX/XX/2023, I made a payment of {$140.00} to my account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I promptly realized a mistake had been made and immediately contacted card services via the XXXX support line to request a cancellation of this charge. I was assured that the charge would be reversed. Consequently, I resubmitted the payment on the same day to my correct account at XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was successfully posted on XX/XX/2023. 

However, I was dismayed to discover that on XX/XX/2023, XXXX 's card services attempted to withdraw another {$140.00} from my now inactive account at XXXX XXXX XXXX. This attempt not only was unauthorized but also resulted in an overdraft fee of {$30.00} being debited from my account. 

Upon contacting XXXX 's card services, even after verifying the accuracy of the aforementioned transactions, I was informed that the charge on XX/XX/2023 ( which is not reflected on my account ) was authorized. I want to categorically state that this charge was not authorized by me and has resulted in financial damages amounting to {$30.00} at the time of lodging this complaint. 

Moreover, I am deeply concerned by the comments made by XXXX 's XXXX Services, indicating potential unauthorized attempts in the future. This raises significant security concerns and demands immediate attention. 

I kindly request the following actions to be taken : A thorough investigation into the unauthorized charge dated XX/XX/2023. 
Reversal of the {$30.00} overdraft fee incurred due to the unauthorized charge. 
XXXX that no future unauthorized attempts will be made on my account. 
A written confirmation detailing the resolution of these matters. 

Your immediate attention and swift resolution of this matter are crucial to maintaining the trust and confidence I have in your institution. I appreciate your understanding and cooperation in advance.

"I signed up for the Chase Bonvoy Marriott credit card XX/XX/2023. They were offering a sign on bonus. I was looking forward to getting the points for future stays at your hotels. If I charged {$3000.00} to the credit card in the first 90 days, they would give me XXXX certificates for free nights and one free night yearly. The Marriott credit card never arrived so I was not able to activate it or use it. They billed me {$95.00} for the annual fee immediately upon my signing up for the card and sent me a bill. It was not until I called them and asked where the card was, they informed me that my first bill was past due. I got them to send me a new card and started using it and immediately paid the {$95.00} bill. I charged {$3000.00} in the next XXXX months and waited for my Marriott bonuses to arrive in my Marriott Bonvoy Account. Unfortunately they never did. I then called your customer service and they said to call Chase. Chase said the {$95.00} did not count and therefore I was not eligible to get the sign up bonus as I was just under the {$3000.00} spend. I asked for a special exception as I was so close to the {$3000.00} and they said NO. So I asked for a refund of my {$95.00} and they said they couldn't give me that either. So I asked them to close my account since they did not provide me with the satisfaction and the performance of those terms according to the credit card agreement I then contacted Chase and after a few calls I was told I WOULD get my {$95.00}. After months of not receiving the refund back, I called several more times. The last time I called, I told them I felt like I was getting ghosted. They finally called me back on XXXX  and told me that they will not refund my {$95.00} because I did not close it according to their terms.. They record the calls and they claim the can not find the call of the representative that told me I would get my {$95.00} refund. Since Marriott is promoting this card in all their Marriott locations, I would like Marriott to be part of this compliant also. Both will not refund my {$95.00} which I am due because they did not give me what was agreed upon sign up for the card. Chase is very cutthroat with their customers when you have an issue with their credit card. When you complain they close your complaint out in XXXX days and make a determination in their favor. If you complaint to the XXXX about them. They just respond and say you can't get a refund based on their policy. A representative told me I would get a refund and now even though they record all calls they can not find that particular recording. I want my {$95.00} refund. Their policy not to refund a customer who did not get the satisfaction promised is deceitful and misleading.

On XX/XX/XXXX, Citi requested I sign XXXX sheets of paper which I sent back by way of email to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for the XXXX charges. See attached for the exact XXXX sheets of paper i sent back. ( This likely confused Citi because they stupidly asked for the same EXACT paper to be signed twice with the same exact dispute number which was XXXX, don't you think since it was XXXX transactions I would need to sign XXXX different pieces of paper with different numbers? ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I took a screenshot of the dispute portal because it switched to "" Thanks for sending us more info '' for XXXX fraud charge, while for the other fraud charge still stated "" We need more info ''. See screenshot XXXX! 

Thinking that was weird, that XXXX charge moved to "" Thanks for sending us more info '' and the other didn't, I resent the XXXX sheets of paper a XXXX time on XX/XX/XXXX.

I am writing to express my frustration with the recent experience I had with Bank of America in relation to a cashier's check deposit. I understand that mistakes happen, but I believe that there should be better communication and transparency when it comes to funding availability.

The bank sent me an email stating that the funds would be available for withdrawal on XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, when I attempted to withdraw the funds, I was informed that they were not yet available.

I reached out to the bank multiple times and spoke to several representatives, but no one could provide me with a clear explanation as to why the funds were not yet available. After being on hold for close to three hours, I was finally told that the funds would be available on XXXX XXXX. Unfortunately, this information was not communicated to me in a timely manner, and I had to wait an additional day to access my funds.

While I understand that mistakes happen, I believe that better communication and transparency could have helped to avoid this situation. As a customer, it is important for me to know when my funds will be available so that I can plan accordingly.

I hope that the bank will take steps to improve its communication and transparency in relation to funding availability, so that customers like myself are not left in the dark.

"On XXXX at XXXX, Bank of America emailed me that my credit card was removed from XXXX XXXX. I checked and saw that my card was still there, but was unusable.

I was unaware my credit card account was closed, until I called the BOA representative where even he was unable to explain why. The representative said he will send a letter today which includes the reason, but BOA system does not allow him or his supervisor to see the reason why, which is completely unreasonable considering how can he, or anyone assist me in that moment without the reason my account was closed. 

I asked what happens to my {$310.00} in rewards, which he told me he had no idea, but he was unable to process it. He said I could dispute it with the bank, but it appears that if BOA is unable to restore my account, that {$310.00} is forfeited which I can not accept. 

I received no warning, no advanced notice, and I always pay my credit card bills on time across BOA, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. Nothing in my XXXX credit report reveals any wrong doing or financial misstep.

When I informed him of this, he asked if I had allowed anyone else to use my debit card, to which I replied in the negative. 

As a precaution, the agent decided to deactivate my card and arrange for a replacement. During our conversation, I mentioned that I had recently sold my XXXX and had forgotten to factory reset it, potentially leaving personal information on the device. The agent filed a claim regarding this issue and assured me that I would receive my new card within 5 to 7 days. Additionally, he mentioned that they would provide an update on the claim status within 10 days. 

However, on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, after about 10 days had passed, I had not received any updates on the status of my claim. Consequently, I decided to call Wells Fargo to inquire about the situation. To my surprise, they informed me that my claim had been denied, as they believed the unauthorized transactions were either made by me or someone I had given permission to. I vehemently explained that I had not authorized these transactions and reiterated the circumstances : the sale of my phone and the loss of my debit card. Unfortunately, they maintained their stance, stating that there was nothing further they could do to assist me.",2.0,3.0,"Dear Customer,

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my frustration with the recent experience I had with Citibank while making payments for my Macy's credit card. On XX/XX/23, I made a payment of {$6100.00} to Citibank using a Citizens bank check, only to find out later that day that the bank check could only be processed in a physical format. I then mailed the same check by Priority mail on XX/XX/23.

To my surprise, my Macy's online statement showed a return check charge for {$30.00} on XX/XX/23. I called Citibank to address this issue and spoke with rep XXXX who adjusted the return check charge. However, my Macy's online statement still showed a balance of - {$12000.00} on XX/XX/23.

I then contacted Citibank again and spoke with rep XXXX, then supervisor XXXX, then mgr XXXX who all verified that the physical check was received on XX/XX/23 and was cashed on XX/XX/23 but they would hold both my return check and the physical check until XX/XX/23. They charged both payments against my account and would not apply them until XX/XX/23.

I understand that processing bank checks can take some time, but I believe that the delay in processing my payment was unreasonable. It caused me a significant inconvenience, and it took me several calls to resolve the issue.

I hope that Citibank will look into this matter and ensure that their policies are clearer about the use of bank checks for online payments. I would also appreciate if they could provide timely updates on the status of my payment and resolve any issues in a prompt manner.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I hope to hear from you soon.

"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX, Iowa XXXX Subject : Appeal Regarding Unsatisfactory Veterinary Service Dispute with Chase Freedom Card I am writing to appeal to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for assistance with a recent transaction dispute on my Chase Freedom card. The transaction in question pertains to a service provided by a veterinarian for the treatment of my dog and cat. The transaction took place on XXXX of XXXX with XXXX XXXX for amount of XXXX dollars. 

Briefly summarized, my pets were administered steroid injections by this new veterinarian with the expectation that it would alleviate their symptoms, including itching, swelling, hotspots, biting, and licking paws. Sadly, three days post-treatment, not only have their symptoms persisted, but they have also significantly worsened. 

Given the lack of improvement and the deteriorating health of my pets, I contacted Chase Freedom 's customer service to dispute the charge, hoping for an understanding and resolution. However, their approach towards the situation was unyielding. They suggested I consult another veterinarian and produce a statement that confirms the ineffectiveness of the previous treatment. While I understand the need for verification, I found this requirement burdensome and potentially inconclusive. A secondary veterinarian, without prior knowledge of my pets ' condition pre-treatment, would be ill-equipped to provide a definitive comparative statement. 

Furthermore, I inquired if Chase would bear the costs for this secondary consultation since it was a condition they imposed, but this was declined. It feels unjust that, in seeking redress for a service that was ineffective, I am compelled to incur further expenses, with no guarantee that they would be recouped. 

It is important to understand that my dispute is not based on mere dissatisfaction but the tangible worsening of my pets ' conditions post-treatment. It is disheartening that the resolution offered involves additional financial and emotional stress for me. 

I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene and guide this matter to a fair resolution. I genuinely believe that I should not be held accountable for charges related to services that not only failed to deliver their promised results but also led to further complications for my pets. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust in the CFPB 's mission to ensure consumers like myself are treated justly in financial dealings and look forward to your guidance.

During the conversation with the representative, they provided me with a clear explanation of the vet's services and assured me that the treatment was effective for their condition. They also offered to provide a refund for the disputed amount upon receipt of verification from the veterinarian confirming that the treatment was indeed ineffective.

While I understand the need for verification, I found this requirement reasonable and acceptable, and I agreed to follow through with it. However, after two weeks, Chase Freedom has yet to receive the verification from the veterinarian, and my refund remains pending.

I kindly request that Chase expedite the review process and provide me with a timeline for when I can expect to receive my refund. I appreciate their willingness to work with me on this matter and hope they can resolve it promptly.

"On XX/XX/2023 I was approved for a credit card from Citibank which had a teaser promotion of 0 % interest for 21 months. At the time of application, I initiated said transfer with a balance I had at XXXX in the maximum amount of the credit given by Citibank of {$17000.00}. During this process, it appeared all was going well, account page indicated transfer was being processed and card was received in mail and activated. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed in the account that the transfer was denied and flagged as fraudulent. No contact from Citibank was made ( or at least that I received ) that there was a problem with the account and said balance transfer. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a call was made to customer service. XXXX agents in addition to XXXX supervisor out of the XXXX XXXX had in fact stated my account was suspended and the transfer was cancelled. However, XXXX said that since "" they verified my identity, I could move forward with the transfer ''. He indicated that I would have to initiate once again and they could not on their side. I then went back to my account where I was once again blocked, and they would not allow me to participate in the transfer where the message "" LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING WENT WRONG '' message appeared.

I am writing to express my frustration with the recent experience I had with your bank regarding a balance transfer of $17,000 from XXXX to Citibank. Upon approval for the credit card with a teaser promotion of 0% interest for 21 months, I initiated the transfer and received confirmation that it was processing. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that my transfer had been denied and flagged as fraudulent.
I then called customer service to inquire about the issue, only to be informed that my account was suspended and the transfer was cancelled because they could not verify my identity. Despite this, I was told that I could move forward with the transfer once it was verified. Unfortunately, when I attempted to initiate the transfer again, I received a message stating that something had gone wrong.
Overall, this experience has left me feeling frustrated and unsure of my ability to trust Citibank with my financial information. If you can provide me with further clarification on what caused the issue and if there are any steps I can take to resolve it, I would greatly appreciate it.

"On XX/XX/2023, my scheduled monthly payment date, I scheduled a one time only online payment for the balance of my credit card debt ; the actual balance for purchases at that time was XXXX dollars ; my one time only online payment was scheduled for that amount. 
I had previously established a XXXX dollar auto pay to be paid on the same day, this is an auto pay that I had established months ago and for many months, I have been paying my balance with that auto pay amount. 

Mistakenly I did not "" uncheck '' the monthly auto pay of XXXX dollars for the pay date of XX/XX/2023, consequently, Citi requested both the XXXX XXXX time only payment and the XXXX auto pay from my bank. The XXXX was paid but the XXXX auto pay was returned as insufficient funds. 

Due to a policy at Citi Bank, Citi created a debit balance for the XXXX dollar returned funds and today they insist that I must pay the XXXX "" outstanding balance ''. I have discussed this issue with Citi Bank Customer service on three occasions, explaining my position that the XXXX dollar "" debit '' is not supported by any purchases and that the balance of my account was paid in full with the {$9000.00} one time only scheduled payment. The XXXX dollar balance is nothing more than an accounting place holder and does not represent any funds spent nor does it represent any funds due. Citi charged their XXXX dollar returned funds fee three times and I paid those fees. 

After the several conversions with customer service representatives and their managers, I've been told that the balance stands and must be paid. Customer service reps nor their managers bothered to look at my account balances- they simply maintain that a returned payment represents a debit and that I am responsible for paying that debit. ( and the returned fund fee ) Citibank Credit cards create debit balances from mistaken attempts to pay off my credit card balance equal to the attempted or mistaken payment regardless if the mistaken payment attempt is represented by any purchases or previous balance. 

After a month of arguing about the unfounded balance they closed my account and are demanding the XXXX dollar fake balance be paid. 

I am seeking to have the XXXX fake balance be recognized for what it is, an accounting place holder and be credited from my account balance. 

I'm sorry I can not provide account summaries that support my. are, once Citi closed my account they denied access to my my previous account statements. The only statement that I have access to is XXXX 's statement which shows {$6600.00} worth of purchases and the XXXX returned payment fee.

"Im writing with regard to a Citi fraud investigation related to a series of fraudulent charges to my Citi Premier card occurring on XX/XX/XXXX. The charges were attributed to a merchant unknown to us ( XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX in the amounts of {$880.00}, {$3400.00}, and {$6000.00}. 

When contacted by the Citi fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX through their early fraud warning system, I was asked whether our card was in our possession. I explained to the caller from Citi that we did have at least one card in our possession, but that this was our previous Citi Thank You Card, not the new upgraded Citi Premier cards wed recently requested. 

In fact, the new Citi Premier cards hadn't arrived through the mail in a timely fashion, leading us to now believe that they may have been intercepted and used for the fraudulent charges. 

I have filed a police report with the XXXX Police Department and can provide you with the report number if needed. 

Yet, according to a letter we received from Citi dated XX/XX/XXXX, Citi has closed the investigation of these charges and is holding us responsible, citing that we had the cards in our possession. I have called twice in the interim to again explain that the cards in our possession at the time of the fraudulent charges were our previous Citi Thank You cards and not the Premier cards that were yet to be received through XXXX mail. 

Note that Citi did determine that two charges taking place on XX/XX/XXXX were indeed fraudulent, and is not holding us accountable -- making it puzzling that they did not determine the fraudulent charges on XX/XX/XXXX as related. 

Pertinent to Citi 's investigation, we also received a bill from XXXX for a fraudulent charge which appeared related to one of the disputed charges ( we are not XXXX customers ). XXXX quickly investigated, verifying that the charge was indeed fraudulent, and has notified the credit bureaus on our behalf. We have provided this information to Citi. We have also provided the XXXX Police Department police report. 

Please let us know if you need any further information from us to assist in asking Citi to reopen the investigation and reconsider their decision.

'' I don't understand this reasoning and asked via phone call about that as well. The phone call said that it was based on Business credit card rules, which were not explained in any detail to me. 

I currently have a working store credit card that Citi services, has a credit limit and that I am able to use. Also this was for a Business credit card, which I don't believe should be affected by Personal credit card rules.",2.0,2.0,"Complaint: My recent application for a Citi Business Credit Card was denied due to credit privileges restrictions on my existing accounts. I find this decision unfair and without proper reasoning.

Tone Severity: 2.0 - The tone of the complaint is harsh and critical, expressing dissatisfaction with the bank's decision-making process.

Case/Event Severity: 1.0 - While the denial of the credit card application may be frustrating, it is not a significant issue that has severely impacted my experience with Citi Bank.

I believe that the restrictions on credit privileges for my existing accounts were applied incorrectly and without proper consideration of my business's unique financial situation. I understand that Citi Bank has certain rules and regulations governing credit card applications, but I expect that these rules are applied fairly and consistently.

I have been a loyal customer of Citi Bank for many years and have always appreciated the excellent service provided by their team. However, this recent experience has left me feeling disappointed and frustrated.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could review my application and provide me with a clear explanation for why I was denied. Additionally, if there are any steps that I can take to address the credit privileges restrictions on my existing accounts, please let me know.",2.0,1.0,,"I am extremely disappointed with the service provided by Citi Bank in regards to my recent application for a Business credit card. Despite having a working store credit card and a good payment history, I was denied the card without any clear explanation of the reasons behind it. The only response I received was a generic message stating that my existing credit privileges were restricted due to business credit card rules.

This is unacceptable and does not demonstrate the high level of customer service and transparency that I expect from Citi Bank. It is crucial that banks provide clear and concise reasons for their decisions, especially when it comes to financial matters. As a customer who has been with Citi Bank for several years, I had hoped for better communication and understanding from my bank in regards to this issue.

I strongly urge Citi Bank to improve its communication skills and provide more transparency in the credit application process. Additionally, I would appreciate it if Citi Bank could review my application again and provide me with a clear explanation of why I was denied the card so that I can work on improving my credit score and have a better chance of being approved in the future.

"I have notified the credit bureaus & XXXX of misreporting bytheir company in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. According to which, as the furnisher of the information in question, you have a grave responsibility of maintaining the accuracy of that information The following account ( XXXX Account Number : XXXX  XXXX ) is reporting a balance of ( {$7000.00} ) when it is my understanding an reason to believe that because this debt was charged off by you that it was memorialized with a Form 1099C as proof or evidence thereof. And that because of that fact, this debt is canceled and at least should not reflect the balance that is currently showing of ( {$7000.00} ) on my consumer file. This would indicate inaccurate reporting on your behalf and therefore is a violation by you the furnisher to continue to report this inaccurate information. Especially with my notice and knowledge confirmation of the errors.This incomplete and inaccurate reporting has had a negative impact on my creditworthiness for too long. To address this matter, I kindly request that you provide me with Form 1099-C, which is required as proof of debt cancellation according to IRS regulations.I have taken the initiative to ensure my financial records are accurate and up-to-date, and I believe that providing Form 1099-C is crucial to establishing the validity of this charge-off. It is my understanding that the absence of this form would render the charge-off entry incomplete and potentially inaccurate. If it is determined that the charge-off entry lacks proper documentation, I request that it be promptly removed from my credit report to ensure the accuracy of my credit profile. 



I XXXX XXXX presents evidence of what I believe to be deceptive and potentially unlawful practices by THD/CBNA ( Citibank N.a ) , the creditor in this case. The evidence I provide below is a communication I received from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a service provider to Citibank N.a, regarding the handling of an unverifiable debt account : [ Attach a copy of the communication EXHIBIT A ] In this communication, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX acknowledges that THD/CBNA placed my account for collection on XX/XX/XXXX, and subsequently recalled it on XX/XX/XXXX. However, I would like to draw the attention to several concerning aspects of this communication : Deceptive Practices : The recall of the account and its subsequent sale to another entity, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Citibank N.a raises concerns about the accuracy and completeness of the information provided to me XXXX XXXX XXXX Deceptive practices, including recalling an account without proper notice or resolution, XXXX be in violation of the FDCPA, which prohibits unfair and deceptive debt collection practices.. 


Lack of Validation : Despite my explicit request for validation of the debt, XXXX Citibank N.a , through its service provider XXXX, failed to provide any substantial documentation or verification of the debt. This failure to validate the debt as requested is a violation of my rights under debt collection laws.

I believe that these actions by XXXX Citibank N.a may be indicative of deceptive and potentially unlawful practices under the FCRA and FDCPA. By recalling the account and subsequently selling it to XXXX & XXXX XXXX for them to sue me for a debt that can not be validated by themselves : Case NO. XXXX, XXXX Citibank N.a may have circumvented the protections provided by these laws, thereby compromising my rights. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( OSCR # XXXX ) is the Debt collection attorney suing me for a debt THD/CBNA knownly lied about recalling account they sold just to resell it a few days later to another debt collection company. NO one at XXXX citibank na can explain to me why a debt collection company is suing me for an unverifiable debt please CFPB help me i do not understand how they can do this.

### Complaint:

Dear [Credit Reporting Agency],

I am writing to file a complaint regarding an error in my credit report. I recently received my credit report and was shocked to see that there were several incorrect items listed on it. These errors have caused me great inconvenience, as they are impacting my ability to obtain new credit.

I understand that mistakes can happen, but I am concerned that this is not the first time this has occurred with my credit reports. In fact, despite making numerous requests for corrections, I have not received any response from your agency regarding these issues.

I request that you investigate these errors thoroughly and take immediate corrective action. Please provide me with a written explanation of the procedures used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information in my credit report. Additionally, please provide me with the names and addresses of any furnishers involved, as well as their telephone numbers.

"Not quite sure but somehow, my credit card account was changed from regular postal mail to paperless billing. Because I check my email rarely only when I expect email, I was not aware of the bill and was charged two months of late fees and interest. On XX/XX/XXXX, Citi finally sent me a postal notice saying that my account was past due and I quickly paid the balance of the charges once I received the letter on XX/XX/XXXX. I also figured out the issue and was able to stop electronic billing. However, because of that I had two months of late fees and finance charges. I was able to get the finance charges waived after speaking with the CSR, but could not get the late fee waived.",2.0,3.0,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my frustration with the recent experience I had with Citibank in regards to my credit card account.

I am writing to express my frustration with the recent billing mix-up I experienced with my credit card account. I was not aware of the change in my billing address from regular postal mail to paperless billing and ended up being charged late fees and interest because I did not receive any notification via email.

I understand that electronic billing is convenient, but it should be done without compromising the customer's ability to stay informed about their accounts. It was a mistake on my part to miss the email notification, and I apologize for not being more attentive to my bills.

Nonetheless, I am disappointed with the way Citi Bank handled this situation. It took too long for me to receive a postal notice, and the late fees and finance charges were unjustified. While I was able to get the finance charges waived after speaking with a customer service representative, I could not get the late fee waived.

I hope that Citi Bank will take steps to prevent similar mix-ups from happening in the future. It is important for customers to receive timely and accurate notification of their bills, especially when there are changes to their billing addresses.
