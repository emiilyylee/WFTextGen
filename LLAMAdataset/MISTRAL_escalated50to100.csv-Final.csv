I am writing to express my extreme frustration with the ongoing issue I have been facing regarding my business credit card rewards points. Despite numerous attempts to redeem them and request products from your rewards website, I have consistently been met with resistance and a complete lack of cooperation from your team.

Not only have I wasted significant amounts of time trying to resolve this issue, but I have also lost out on valuable rewards that I had earned through my patronage of your bank. The fact that you continue to ignore my requests and refuse to honor my rewards points is not only disrespectful, but it also undermines the trust that I once placed in your institution.

I am appalled at the level of service that I have received from Wells Fargo and I demand that this issue be resolved immediately. It is unacceptable for a bank to mistreat its customers in such a manner and I will no longer do business with you ever again.

This is not just an isolated incident, but it is a reflection of the broader problem with customer service at Wells Fargo. Your team's inability to handle simple issues in a timely and effective manner raises serious questions about your ability to provide adequate support to your customers.

I urge you to take this matter seriously and take immediate action to resolve the issue. Failure to do so will result in legal action being taken against Wells Fargo and I will not hesitate to pursue this option if necessary.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",2.0,3.0,,"I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the customer service provided by Wells Fargo in connection with my business credit card. I have been attempting for the last 20 days to redeem my rewards points and receive the products and money that I rightfully deserve, but my requests have been met with nothing but obstacles and delays.

Despite my repeated attempts to contact Wells Fargo through their customer service phone lines and emails, I have not been able to receive any assistance or resolution to this issue. The representatives I have spoken with are unresponsive and unwilling to address my concerns, making it impossible for me to resolve this matter in a timely manner.

The severity of this issue cannot be overstated. As a business owner, I rely on my credit card rewards to help me grow and expand my business, and the fact that Wells Fargo will not honor these rewards is nothing short of disgraceful. Not only does this undermine my trust in Wells Fargo as a bank, but it also affects my ability to conduct business and make informed decisions about my financial future.

I demand that Wells Fargo immediately address this issue and provide me with the redemption options I am entitled to under their rewards program. I will not accept any further delays or excuses from them, and I will take legal action if they do not comply with my demands.

In addition to addressing this specific issue, I also urge Wells Fargo to improve its customer service across the board. The tone and attitude of the representatives I have spoken with are abhorrent and unprofessional, and it is clear that the bank's priorities lie elsewhere. If Wells Fargo wants to retain customers like myself and maintain a positive reputation in the financial industry, they must make significant changes to their customer service practices.

I will no longer do business with Wells Fargo and will recommend that others avoid them as well. This is not just about my rewards points – it's about the way that Wells Fargo treats its customers and prioritizes profits over people.",3.0,2.0,,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0
"I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern and seek immediate resolution regarding an unauthorized charge and the subsequent overdraft fee incurred on my account. 

On XX/XX/2023, I made a payment of {$140.00} to my account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I promptly realized a mistake had been made and immediately contacted card services via the XXXX support line to request a cancellation of this charge. I was assured that the charge would be reversed. Consequently, I resubmitted the payment on the same day to my correct account at XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was successfully posted on XX/XX/2023. 

However, I was dismayed to discover that on XX/XX/2023, XXXX 's card services attempted to withdraw another {$140.00} from my now inactive account at XXXX XXXX XXXX. This attempt not only was unauthorized but also resulted in an overdraft fee of {$30.00} being debited from my account. 

Upon contacting XXXX 's card services, even after verifying the accuracy of the aforementioned transactions, I was informed that the charge on XX/XX/2023 ( which is not reflected on my account ) was authorized. I want to categorically state that this charge was not authorized by me and has resulted in financial damages amounting to {$30.00} at the time of lodging this complaint. 

Moreover, I am deeply concerned by the comments made by XXXX 's XXXX Services, indicating potential unauthorized attempts in the future. This raises significant security concerns and demands immediate attention. 

I kindly request the following actions to be taken : A thorough investigation into the unauthorized charge dated XX/XX/2023. 
Reversal of the {$30.00} overdraft fee incurred due to the unauthorized charge. 
XXXX that no future unauthorized attempts will be made on my account. 
A written confirmation detailing the resolution of these matters. 

Your immediate attention and swift resolution of this matter are crucial to maintaining the trust and confidence I have in your institution. I appreciate your understanding and cooperation in advance.

I am writing in anger and disgust to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the customer service I have received from your bank. On XX/XX/2023, I made a payment of {$140.00} to my account with XXXX XXXX XXXXX. Immediately upon receiving this payment, I was informed that it had been fraudulently charged without my consent.

I contacted your customer service department via the XXXX support line, but I was met with a hostile and unresponsive attitude from the representative who claimed that the charge was authorized. The representative refused to listen to my explanation or provide any details about the transaction. I was left with no choice but to escalate this issue to your bank's fraud department, which only added more frustration and anger to an already difficult situation.

The fraudulent charge has resulted in financial losses amounting to {$140.00}, and it took me several days to get the situation resolved. Despite my repeated attempts to contact customer service, I was met with the same hostile attitude from each representative I spoke with. It is a complete disgrace that your bank allows this kind of behavior towards its customers.

I demand immediate action to be taken against whoever is responsible for this fraudulent charge and the subsequent overdraft fee. I also expect a full refund of my losses and a written apology from your bank. Furthermore, I want to know what measures are being taken to prevent such incidents in the future.

If I do not receive a satisfactory response to this complaint within 72 hours, I will be forced to switch banks immediately. Your bank has lost my trust and loyalty forever. I hope that you take this seriously and act accordingly.

However, without prior notice or warning, XXXX's card services attempted to withdraw another {$140.00} from my inactive account at XXXX XXXX XXXX, resulting in a fraudulent overdraft fee of {$30.00} being debited from my account.

Furthermore, I demand that XXXX take steps to prevent any future fraudulent attempts against my account and provide me with written confirmation detailing the resolution of this matter.

"I signed up for the Chase Bonvoy Marriott credit card XX/XX/2023. They were offering a sign on bonus. I was looking forward to getting the points for future stays at your hotels. If I charged {$3000.00} to the credit card in the first 90 days, they would give me XXXX certificates for free nights and one free night yearly. The Marriott credit card never arrived so I was not able to activate it or use it. They billed me {$95.00} for the annual fee immediately upon my signing up for the card and sent me a bill. It was not until I called them and asked where the card was, they informed me that my first bill was past due. I got them to send me a new card and started using it and immediately paid the {$95.00} bill. I charged {$3000.00} in the next XXXX months and waited for my Marriott bonuses to arrive in my Marriott Bonvoy Account. Unfortunately they never did. I then called your customer service and they said to call Chase. Chase said the {$95.00} did not count and therefore I was not eligible to get the sign up bonus as I was just under the {$3000.00} spend. I asked for a special exception as I was so close to the {$3000.00} and they said NO. So I asked for a refund of my {$95.00} and they said they couldn't give me that either. So I asked them to close my account since they did not provide me with the satisfaction and the performance of those terms according to the credit card agreement I then contacted Chase and after a few calls I was told I WOULD get my {$95.00}. After months of not receiving the refund back, I called several more times. The last time I called, I told them I felt like I was getting ghosted. They finally called me back on XXXX  and told me that they will not refund my {$95.00} because I did not close it according to their terms.. They record the calls and they claim the can not find the call of the representative that told me I would get my {$95.00} refund. Since Marriott is promoting this card in all their Marriott locations, I would like Marriott to be part of this compliant also. Both will not refund my {$95.00} which I am due because they did not give me what was agreed upon sign up for the card.

A representative told me I would get a refund and now even though they record all calls they can not find that particular recording. I want my {$95.00} refund.

I am writing to express my extreme frustration with the banking services provided by Citi Bank. Recently, I received a Citi card that was sent to a different address than where I reside. Despite this error in delivery, I began using the card at Costco XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. However, I only used the card three times within a day or two.
When I received my bill, I paid for the purchases that I had made on the card. However, to my surprise, I was told that the card had been used in many locations and different states. Despite my claims of possession and the fact that I disputed the charges with the credit card company, they denied the claim because they said I still had the card in my possession.
The initial error in delivery is a severe issue that has had a significant impact on my overall experience with Citi Bank. The fact that the bank does not see any other address on file is even more concerning, as it suggests that the bank did not take appropriate steps to verify my identity or ensure that the card was delivered to the correct address.
I demand that Citi Bank takes immediate action to resolve this issue and prevent similar errors from occurring in the future. I also demand compensation for the losses that I have incurred as a result of this error, including the cost of the disputed charges and any additional fees or interest that may be accruing on my account.

I also want to be compensated for the time and effort I have had to put into resolving this issue, as well as the cost of any unauthorized charges that were made on my account.

Citibank Customer Service",2.0,3.0,,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my frustration with the recent experience I had with Citibank, a commercial bank that I have been a loyal customer of for many years. This issue has not only caused me significant inconvenience, but also impacted my credit score and left me feeling violated and afraid.

When I applied for a new credit card from Citibank, I was shocked to find out that my physical address on file did not match the one listed on my license. Despite the fact that I do not receive mail at that address, it appears that Citibank used this information to deny me the card and then opened an account in my name without my knowledge or consent.

I have tried multiple times to contact Citibank customer service to resolve this issue, but I have been met with nothing but frustration and confusion. Despite providing them with the correct address and my social security number, they continue to insist that I have a card in my possession and refuse to close the account.

This situation has left me feeling violated and afraid that someone may have access to my personal information and be using my credit card fraudulently. It is unacceptable for a reputable financial institution like Citibank to make such careless mistakes with their customer's personal information, and I expect better from them.

I am writing this complaint to escalate the issue to the highest authorities at Citibank, and demand that they take immediate action to resolve this matter. I cannot in good conscience continue to do business with a bank that is so careless with their customer's information, and I urge others to consider doing the same.

Sincerely,

"On Monday, XX/XX/2023, a Wells Fargo agent called me to inform me of suspicious activities in my account. He explained that he needed to verify certain transactions, and we went through each of the ten transactions individually. During this review, we identified three unauthorized withdrawalstwo of {$500.00} each and one of {$200.00}, all from non-Wells Fargo ATMs. The total amount of these unauthorized transactions was {$1400.00}. The agent asked me to confirm if my debit card was in my possession, but upon checking, I realized that I had misplaced it. When I informed him of this, he asked if I had allowed anyone else to use my debit card, to which I replied in the negative. 

As a precaution, the agent decided to deactivate my card and arrange for a replacement. During our conversation, I mentioned that I had recently sold my XXXX and had forgotten to factory reset it, potentially leaving personal information on the device. The agent filed a claim regarding this issue and assured me that I would receive my new card within 5 to 7 days. Additionally, he mentioned that they would provide an update on the claim status within 10 days. 

However, on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, after about 10 days had passed, I had not received any updates on the status of my claim. Consequently, I decided to call Wells Fargo to inquire about the situation. To my surprise, they informed me that my claim had been denied, as they believed the unauthorized transactions were either made by me or someone I had given permission to. I vehemently explained that I had not authorized these transactions and reiterated the circumstances : the sale of my phone and the loss of my debit card.

"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX, Iowa XXXX Subject : Appeal Regarding Unsatisfactory Veterinary Service Dispute with Chase Freedom Card I am writing to appeal to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for assistance with a recent transaction dispute on my Chase Freedom card. The transaction in question pertains to a service provided by a veterinarian for the treatment of my dog and cat. The transaction took place on XXXX of XXXX with XXXX XXXX for amount of XXXX dollars. 

Briefly summarized, my pets were administered steroid injections by this new veterinarian with the expectation that it would alleviate their symptoms, including itching, swelling, hotspots, biting, and licking paws. Sadly, three days post-treatment, not only have their symptoms persisted, but they have also significantly worsened. 

Given the lack of improvement and the deteriorating health of my pets, I contacted Chase Freedom 's customer service to dispute the charge, hoping for an understanding and resolution. However, their approach towards the situation was unyielding. They suggested I consult another veterinarian and produce a statement that confirms the ineffectiveness of the previous treatment. While I understand the need for verification, I found this requirement burdensome and potentially inconclusive. A secondary veterinarian, without prior knowledge of my pets ' condition pre-treatment, would be ill-equipped to provide a definitive comparative statement. 

Furthermore, I inquired if Chase would bear the costs for this secondary consultation since it was a condition they imposed, but this was declined. It feels unjust that, in seeking redress for a service that was ineffective, I am compelled to incur further expenses, with no guarantee that they would be recouped. 

It is important to understand that my dispute is not based on mere dissatisfaction but the tangible worsening of my pets ' conditions post-treatment. It is disheartening that the resolution offered involves additional financial and emotional stress for me. 

I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene and guide this matter to a fair resolution. I genuinely believe that I should not be held accountable for charges related to services that not only failed to deliver their promised results but also led to further complications for my pets. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust in the CFPB 's mission to ensure consumers like myself are treated justly in financial dealings and look forward to your guidance. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",2.0,2.0,"Complaint Regarding Fraudulent Charge on Chase Freedom Card I am writing to formally complain about the fraudulent charge made on my Chase Freedom card on XXXX of XXXX for an unauthorized purchase. The amount in question was XXXX dollars, and this transaction took place at a popular restaurant chain, XXXXX, located near my home. 

The fraudulent charge came to my attention when I checked my account balance and saw that I had been charged for a meal I did not consume. Upon further investigation, I realized that my card had been stolen or lost, likely during one of the many times I left it out in public while dining out or shopping. 

Despite attempts to contact Chase Freedom customer service, their response was slow and unhelpful. They advised me to file a police report and wait for funds to be returned to my account, which took over a month. During this time, I had to pay the XXXX dollars in question, further stressing my already tight budget. 

In addition, Chase's response was insensitive and dismissive of my concerns about identity theft and fraud. They suggested that I ""deal with it"" and move on, instead of offering any form of compensation or assistance. It feels like they are not taking this matter seriously enough, and their lack of action has left me feeling frustrated and violated. 

As a loyal customer of Chase Freedom for many years, I am disappointed to see them handle this situation with such disregard for my well-being and financial security. I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter thoroughly and ensure that Chase is held accountable for their actions. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in the CFPB's mission to protect consumers from fraudulent activities such as these, and look forward to a favorable outcome.

The transaction in question pertains to an unauthorized withdrawal of $5,000 from my savings account on XXXX of XXXX. 

It is disheartening to realize that my personal information and financial security have been compromised by this fraudulent activity, causing irreparable harm not only to me but also to my family. The lack of transparency and action from Chase's customer service team has only compounded the situation and added immense stress to our lives. 

I have attempted countless times to resolve the issue with Chase's fraud department, but their response has been unresponsive and inadequate. They have failed to provide clear answers regarding how this fraudulent charge occurred and when it will be resolved. Furthermore, they have refused to refund my stolen funds and have instead offered a minimal compensation of $500. 

I find this approach completely unacceptable and believe that I deserve better treatment as a longtime customer of Chase Bank. This incident has left me questioning the safety and security of my account, and I fear that it may not be safe to continue doing business with them in the future. 

It is imperative that Chase takes immediate action to investigate this fraudulent charge and ensure that my account is secure once again. I demand a refund of my stolen funds and a full explanation of how this incident occurred. Furthermore, I request that they take all necessary steps to prevent any further fraudulent activity from occurring in the future. 

I urge you to intervene in this matter and guide Chase Bank towards a fair resolution. As a consumer protection agency, it is your responsibility to ensure that individuals like myself are treated fairly and justly when it comes to financial matters.

I had previously established a XXXX dollar auto pay to be paid on the same day, this is an auto pay that I had established months ago and for many months, I have been paying my balance with that auto pay amount. 

Mistakenly I did not "" uncheck '' the monthly auto pay of XXXX dollars for the pay date of XX/XX/2023, consequently, Citi requested both the XXXX XXXX time only payment and the XXXX auto pay from my bank. The XXXX was paid but the XXXX auto pay was returned as insufficient funds.

I have discussed this issue with Citi Bank Customer service on three occasions, explaining my position that the XXXX dollar "" debit '' is not supported by any purchases and that the balance of my account was paid in full with the {$9000.00} one time only scheduled payment. The XXXX dollar balance is nothing more than an accounting place holder and does not represent any funds spent nor does it represent any funds due. Citi charged their XXXX dollar returned funds fee three times and I paid those fees. 

After the several conversions with customer service representatives and their managers, I've been told that the balance stands and must be paid. Customer service reps nor their managers bothered to look at my account balances- they simply maintain that a returned payment represents a debit and that I am responsible for paying that debit.

I currently have a working store credit card that Citi services, has a credit limit and that I am able to use. Also this was for a Business credit card, which I don't believe should be affected by Personal credit card rules.",2.0,2.0,"I cannot believe that Citi Bank has denied me for a Business credit card simply because of my personal credit score and history. The reasoning that ""The credit privileges on your existing accounts are currently restricted"" is nothing more than a bullshit excuse to deny me access to the credit I need for my business to continue growing. 

This issue is severe, as it has significant impact on my ability to run my business effectively. The fact that Citi Bank cannot explain their decision or provide any detail regarding their ""Business credit card rules"" only adds to the frustration and confusion. 

I demand that this denial be overturned immediately and that I be given access to the credit I need for my business. This is not a request, but a demand. If Citi Bank continues to act in this manner, they will lose me as a customer forever.",2.0,3.0,,"I am writing to express my extreme frustration with the denial of my Business credit card application by Citibank. The reasoning provided for the denial was based on ""business credit card rules,"" which were not explained in any detail to me. I have been a loyal customer of Citibank for many years and have consistently maintained good credit on both my personal and business accounts.

Despite this, I was denied for a Business credit card because of what seems to be an arbitrary decision made by the bank's credit department. This is a clear violation of Citibank's own credit policies, which state that credit decisions are based on individual circumstances and creditworthiness.

I find it extremely disrespectful that Citibank would deny me a credit card based on my credit history without providing any specific reasons or solutions for improvement. I have tried to contact the bank via phone several times but have been met with a rude and dismissive attitude from customer service representatives.

I demand that Citibank immediately reconsider my application and provide clear and specific explanations for their decision-making process. If this is not done, I will be forced to look for alternative financial institutions and will no longer do business with Citibank.

According to which, as the furnisher of the information in question, you have a grave responsibility of maintaining the accuracy of that information The following account ( XXXX Account Number : XXXX  XXXX ) is reporting a balance of ( {$7000.00} ) when it is my understanding an reason to believe that because this debt was charged off by you that it was memorialized with a Form 1099C as proof or evidence thereof. And that because of that fact, this debt is canceled and at least should not reflect the balance that is currently showing of ( {$7000.00} ) on my consumer file. This would indicate inaccurate reporting on your behalf and therefore is a violation by you the furnisher to continue to report this inaccurate information. Especially with my notice and knowledge confirmation of the errors.This incomplete and inaccurate reporting has had a negative impact on my creditworthiness for too long. To address this matter, I kindly request that you provide me with Form 1099-C, which is required as proof of debt cancellation according to IRS regulations.I have taken the initiative to ensure my financial records are accurate and up-to-date, and I believe that providing Form 1099-C is crucial to establishing the validity of this charge-off. It is my understanding that the absence of this form would render the charge-off entry incomplete and potentially inaccurate. If it is determined that the charge-off entry lacks proper documentation, I request that it be promptly removed from my credit report to ensure the accuracy of my credit profile.

Lack of Validation : Despite my explicit request for validation of the debt, XXXX Citibank N.a , through its service provider XXXX, failed to provide any substantial documentation or verification of the debt. This failure to validate the debt as requested is a violation of my rights under debt collection laws.

I believe that these actions by XXXX Citibank N.a may be indicative of deceptive and potentially unlawful practices under the FCRA and FDCPA. By recalling the account and subsequently selling it to XXXX & XXXX XXXX for them to sue me for a debt that can not be validated by themselves : Case NO. XXXX, XXXX Citibank N.a may have circumvented the protections provided by these laws, thereby compromising my rights. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( OSCR # XXXX ) is the Debt collection attorney suing me for a debt THD/CBNA knownly lied about recalling account they sold just to resell it a few days later to another debt collection company. NO one at XXXX citibank na can explain to me why a debt collection company is suing me for an unverifiable debt please CFPB help me i do not understand how they can do this.

"Bank of America opened a credit card account in XXXX of XXXX  without my knowledge or permission. They used a XXXX party that resulted in a hard pull on my credit report and they haven't corrected it even after I brought it to their attention. 

I received a credit alert from my existing accounts that I had applied for a credit card. Since I hadn't applied for credit I initially believed this was an identify theft situation and I locked my report and asked Bank of America to correct my report. 

Only after a significant amount of time and reading stories about how Bank of America was opening accounts without customer permission did I realize what had taken place. 

I have multiple personal and business accounts with Bank of America so this remains shocking that that they would do this to me.",2.0,2.0,"Thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention.

The tone of the response is polite and professional but it also acknowledges that the customer is upset and frustrated with the situation. The tone is not confrontational, but it does express concern for the customer's well-being and a willingness to address their concerns.

"Not quite sure but somehow, my credit card account was changed from regular postal mail to paperless billing. Because I check my email rarely only when I expect email, I was not aware of the bill and was charged two months of late fees and interest.
