I noticed my Chase account had been charged {$16.00} for an Amazon XXXX account for the last 17 months. I didnt notice initially cause I thought it was our Amazon account but my husband informed me that he pays for our Amazon account with his credit card not our debit account. I contacted Amazon for more information and found out it isnt our account at all but I was being charged for it. We checked if friends or family use the account but nothing. I contacted chase and let them know what I discovered. They made claims for all of the money that was taken fraudulently. They informed me today that they wouldnt be returning my money because it was over 60 days old. They would only return 3 payments.

I am writing this complaint because of my recent experience with your bank. Over the past 17 months, I have been charged $16.00 for an Amazon account that is not mine. My husband informed me that he pays for our Amazon account using his credit card, not our debit account. When I contacted Amazon for more information, I was told that it was not my account and that someone had been fraudulently using my personal information to make unauthorized charges.

I reached out to your bank and provided all the necessary documentation, but you have refused to return the stolen money. You claim that it is too late, even though I only discovered the fraudulent activity a few months ago. I find this to be an outrageous and unacceptable behavior on your part. The money that was taken from my account is not mine, and I demand that you return it immediately.

I am extremely disappointed with your bank's handling of this situation. Your failure to act promptly and fairly in this matter has caused me significant distress, and I will no longer do business with you. I urge all customers to be cautious when dealing with banks such as yours.

I am writing to express my extreme frustration with the customer service at Wells Fargo for over three decades of patronage. I have been banking with your institution since 19XX, but in recent years, I have encountered a series of issues that have left me feeling disrespected and let down.

One such issue is the persistent reversal of fees charged on my safety deposit boxes. As per the signed agreement and multiple communications with your customer service representatives, the bank agreed to provide the boxes for free as long as we maintained our accounts. However, different store managers have continued to charge these fees, leaving me with no choice but to bring the matter to your attention again and again.

I have reached out to the business line of communication executive office multiple times, only to be met with a lack of understanding or concern for my concerns. Despite presenting them with proof of the agreement and the past practice of waiving fees, I continue to be charged without explanation or resolution.

This is not the only instance of poor customer service that I have experienced at Wells Fargo. In fact, there have been numerous occasions where I have had to contend with unapproved charges, denied transactions, and other issues that have left me feeling frustrated and disrespected.

As a long-time customer, I am entitled to expect better from an institution like Wells Fargo. Unfortunately, my experience over the past few years has left me questioning whether it is worth continuing to do business with your bank. If these issues continue to persist, I will have no choice but to take my business elsewhere.

I urge you to address these concerns promptly and appropriately. Your customers rely on your institution to provide reliable financial services and exceptional customer service. Please make it clear that my complaints are being taken seriously and a resolution will be forthcoming.

Despite being a loyal customer of your bank for over XXXX years, I have been constantly harassed and denied access to my boxes due to unauthorized fees that were charged without any prior notice or consent.

Your customer service agents have shown no remorse or understanding of the situation, and have even gone as far as to refuse to remove the charges levied on my safety deposit boxes. This is a clear violation of the agreement I signed with your bank, which states that my safety deposit boxes would be given to me for free, so long as I maintain an account with your institution.

I am extremely disappointed in the way your bank has treated me and am considering leaving your services altogether if this issue is not resolved promptly. Your lack of customer service and disregard for the rights of your clients are unacceptable and I demand that you take immediate action to rectify this situation.

I am writing to express my extreme frustration with Citibank for making my savings account inactive without any prior notice or warning.

I received several emails warning me about an account being made inactive, but I did not receive any correspondence regarding my specific savings account.

However, even after sending the letter and following up with customer service, my account remains inactive.

The fact that there are no Citibank locations within XXXX hours of me only adds to my frustration. I am not able to visit a branch or speak to a representative in person, which makes it very difficult for me to resolve this issue.

I am writing to express my frustration with Citibank for inactivating my savings account without proper notice or explanation. Despite being a long-standing customer of over XXXX years, I have been unable to resolve this issue and it has caused significant inconvenience and distress.

The tone of Citibank's communication has been harsh and confrontational, with no apologies or explanations for the inactive status of my account. My attempts to rectify the situation, including sending letters and using priority mail with tracking, have been met with indifference and lack of resolve from customer service representatives.

I have taken Citibank's actions as a clear indication that they value my business and reputation less than other customers. The severity of this situation demands immediate action from Citibank to reinstate my account and provide appropriate compensation for the inconvenience caused.

I want to emphasize that I have made full payment towards this credit card account, and I possess the necessary evidence to support this fact. 

According to the provisions outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1637 - Open end consumer credit plans ( C ) Payments at local branches. 
If the creditor, in the case of a credit card account referred to in subparagraph ( A ), is a financial institution which maintains branches or offices at which payments on any such account are accepted from the obligor in person, the date on which the obligor makes a payment on the account at such branch or office shall be considered to be the date on which the payment is made for purposes of determining whether a late fee or charge may be imposed due to the failure of the obligor to make payment on or before the due date for such payment.

To substantiate my claim of full payment, I am prepared to provide documented proof, which includes a copy of the payment made at the Bank of America branch, as well as any other necessary documentation that demonstrates the complete repayment of my debt. Additionally, I possess video evidence of the transaction that took place at the bank branch.",2.0,2.0,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I am extremely disappointed with the way my Bank of America account has been handled. In March, I made a payment at the bank branch in person, as evidenced by the video I have provided. However, despite this, I was mistakenly reported as 30 days past due on my credit report. This has caused immense stress and damage to my credit score, and I cannot believe that Bank of America would make such a careless mistake.

I have tried to rectify the issue numerous times, but I have been met with nothing but frustration. When I called customer service, I was passed around to several different representatives who claimed to not have any knowledge of my account. This only added to my stress and made me feel as though my concerns were being ignored.

I am writing to express my extreme frustration with the mistreatment I have received from Bank of America in regards to my credit card account. It is unbelievable that despite providing clear evidence of full payment, a 30-day past due notation has been incorrectly reported on my credit profile. This has caused significant damage to my credit score and overall financial stability, and it is time for Bank of America to take responsibility for their actions.

As a loyal customer of Bank of America, I have always trusted this bank with my financial needs. However, my recent experience with your customer service team has left me feeling betrayed and disappointed. The representative I spoke with was unprofessional and dismissive of my concerns, refusing to acknowledge the evidence I presented and instead insisting that I pay a late fee for the supposedly past-due payment.

This is completely unacceptable, as it goes against the clear provisions outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1637. According to these provisions, if the creditor is a financial institution like Bank of America and maintains branches where payments on an account can be made in person, then the date on which the payment is made at the branch should be considered the date of payment for determining whether a late fee or charge may be imposed. In this case, I made the payment at a Bank of America branch, and the evidence clearly shows that I paid on time.

I demand that Bank of America rectify this error immediately and remove the false 30-day past due notation from my credit report. Furthermore, I demand compensation for the financial damages caused by this mistake. If Bank of America fails to address this issue promptly, I will be forced to take legal action against your bank.

This is not just an isolated incident - it is a pattern of mistreatment towards loyal customers who have been wronged by Bank of America's incompetent and unresponsive customer service team. It is time for Bank of America to take responsibility for their actions and make amends for the harm they have caused their customers.

Dear Customer Service Team,

I am writing today to express my extreme frustration with the handling of my recent credit card dispute. Despite my repeated attempts to resolve the issue, I have been met with numerous obstacles and inconsistencies from your team.

Firstly, when I received a letter stating that my claim had been approved, I was excited to see a credit of XXXX XXXX appear in my account. However, this happiness was quickly dissipated when I noticed that the amount of the claim, XXXX, had been debited from my account shortly after. This led me to realize that I had not received the full credit for my dispute and that I needed to escalate the issue further.

Despite my attempts to reach out and speak with a representative, I was repeatedly transferred between departments without receiving any resolution. It took numerous calls and emails before I was finally able to speak with someone who could help me understand the situation.

To make matters worse, the representative I spoke with seemed to have little knowledge or understanding of my case. They were unable to provide me with a clear explanation of why my credit had been reversed or when it would be corrected. Instead, they told me that I needed to wait for a creditor to submit a correction request.

This lack of transparency and accountability is unacceptable. As a long-time customer of your bank, I expect that you will handle my dispute fairly and efficiently. Unfortunately, I have not received the level of service that I deserve.

I demand that this issue be resolved immediately. I want to see the XXXX credit restored to my account and for someone from your team to reach out to me within the next 24 hours to provide a detailed explanation of what happened and how it will be corrected.

If I do not receive a satisfactory response, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter further. This includes taking legal action against your bank and filing a complaint with relevant regulatory bodies.

I ask that you take immediate action to address this situation and ensure that your customer service representatives are properly trained and equipped with the necessary knowledge to assist customers in a respectful and professional manner. This incident has left me questioning whether Wells Fargo is truly committed to providing excellent customer service, and I urge you to take steps to improve this aspect of your business.

Dear Wells Fargo Customer Service Team,

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the recent experience I had when contacting your customer service department on XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXX time central. My intent was to get some guidance on how to deposit a foreign currency check into both my business and personal checking accounts.

From the start, the representative, who was a female, displayed an uncooperative and dismissive attitude, without being willing to provide any helpful information or clarification. When I attempted to focus the conversation and ask specific questions, she threatened to hang up the call. Despite my repeated attempts to engage in a constructive dialogue and clarify my queries, she continued to behave in an abrupt manner, and we were on the phone call for almost XXXX minutes (including waiting time and navigating through the menu initially).

The lack of empathy, willingness to assist, and the threat to hang up the call were unacceptable and left me feeling extremely disappointed with your bank. As a long-term customer, I have always expected a high level of professionalism and support from your team. Unfortunately, my experience with this representative did not meet my expectations, and I feel compelled to escalate this case severity = 3.0 and tone severity = 2.0.

I demand that you take immediate action to address the issue and prevent similar incidents in the future. I urge you to provide me with a prompt response and resolution to this matter, as it not only affects my personal experience but also damages the reputation of your bank.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",3.0,2.0,
"I noticed and reported fraud on my Bank of America credit card on XX/XX/2023 while the transactions were still in a pending status. 

There was two charges ( one for {$930.00} and another for {$790.00} ) from Spirit airlines that were not authorized by me. I have never done any business with this airline. 

Bank of America investigated my claim and provided a partial reversal of the fraudulent charges, {$930.00} was reversed and the rest was not. 
They also provided partial documentation from Spirit airlines advising me that I received services and am responsible for the {$790.00} charge. 

I contacted Spirit airlines and they would not investigate this matter since Bank of America had to initiate this process. They were able to send me some documentation of how the airline ticket was purchased along with an email and phone number that did not belong to me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to appeal Bank of Americas decision and was advised I had to start a new claim/dispute as the initial claim was closed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested an email or mailing address to submit a formal written complaint and their representative XXXX from Arkansas advised they do not have one and I can only proceed to file a complaint with her over the phone. 

I do not understand how one charge was considered fraudulent and the other valid since the same person/contact info processed both transactions. 
Bank of America did not thoroughly investigate these fraudulent charges and my credit score has been negatively impacted due to carrying a balance of this credit card.",3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,
"I am filing this formal complaint against Wells Fargo for the unjust denial of my debit card dispute claims, which were submitted on XX/XX/2023, and XX/XX/2023. The transactions in question involve amounts of {$520.00} and {$19.00}, both dated XX/XX/2023. 

Despite providing substantial evidence, including a police report filed with the XXXX XXXX XXXX Sheriff Department on XX/XX/2023, and security camera footage verifying the fraudulent transactions, Wells Fargo dismissed my claims without any credible justification. 

This denial is not only unacceptable but also in violation of my rights under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) and Regulation E, which mandate that I am entitled to a detailed written explanation for the denial of my dispute claims. Wells Fargo 's failure to provide this explanation is a direct infringement of these regulations. 

I demand immediate action to rectify this situation, including a thorough investigation into Wells Fargo 's dispute resolution process. Failure to address this complaint will leave me with no option but to seek further legal recourse. 

I expect prompt attention to this urgent matter.",3.0,2.0,,,,,,,,
"Hello, I am writing to bring up a case of negligence in handling a wire fraud incident that I fell victim to. I believe that inadequate procedures and actions have led to the loss of a significant amount of my funds and have caused considerable distress to my family and me. 

On XX/XX/2023, I was targeted by fraudsters who impersonated our title company and deceived me into wiring {$87000.00} from my Wells Fargo checking account to a fraudulent account at XXXX. The fraudulent nature of the transaction came to light the following day, prompting me to report the incident to Wells Fargo immediately. I also took further action by filing a complaint on ic3.gov. 

Following the incident, both Wells Fargo and XXXX were engaged in the investigative process. XXXXXXXX XXXX  Wire Fraud Department not only verified the presence of the precise amount within the fraudulent account but also ascertained that the said account had been promptly frozen on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, a representative from XXXX 's XXXX branch confirmed the frozen status of the account to me and conveyed that it was slated for closure within 30 days, assuring me that the funds would be returned to me within this timeframe. Despite these confirmations and assurances, the subsequent course of actions have been markedly disappointing. 

Regrettably, I must inform you that Wells Fargo has taken a concerning stance. They are currently refusing to provide me with assistance by sharing the findings of their investigation, despite my exercise of the right to documentation. The information contained within this document, coupled with the statement from the Wells Fargo banker regarding his communication on the frozen status of the account, holds critical significance for my pursuit of repayment from XXXX. 

Despite my proactive efforts and cooperation, the situation has escalated into a complex ordeal, where not only the mishandling of the wire recall process by XXXX has resulted in severe financial and emotional consequences, but also Wells Fargo 's reluctance to provide necessary information further exacerbates the distressing circumstances. 

I am seeking your intervention in this matter to address the negligence displayed by both Wells Fargo and XXXX. The disregard for proper procedures and the mishandling of the wire recall process have resulted in the loss of our hard-earned savings and an overwhelming sense of injustice. 

I kindly request that your office investigate this incident thoroughly and bring the unjust bank practices to light. Additionally, I am seeking guidance on potential avenues for recovering the wrongfully released funds, including any assistance your office may be able to provide in cooperation with relevant authorities. 

Thanks, XXXX XXXX ( P.S. I am happy to provide any necessary documents that I have regarding communications that I had with XXXX and Wells Fargo to assist in this investigation )",3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,

They then allowed my account to be overdrawn by nearly XXXX dollars after the conversation. They further went on to deny my claims without doing a thorough and legitimate investigation.

The imposter wanted me to verify several charges that morning with my debit card. I did not make any charges that morning. He stated two charges in XXXX, Florida, one at a XXXX for about {$240.00} and one at an XXXX store for about {$1000.00}. I said no. While I was on the phone he said our account was also being flagged for a XX/XX/XXXXtransfer for {$500.00} to someone named XXXX XXXX. I said no that was not me. In addition he said someone transferred {$1700.00} from my checking account to my savings account. I was very concerned because this showed they had access to my online banking. He asked if my husband might have made the transfer. I said no. He said he would have to close the account and give me a new account to transfer my funds into. He said it would take about 2 minutes and put me on hold. It all sounded very professional and I was looking at my account and it looked like there was a transfer made without my knowledge of {$1700.00} into my savings account. So I was glad I thought the fraud department caught it before it got out of hand. Then he came back on the phone and said he had to lock my phone? Asked what phone company I use and I told himXX/XX/XXXX. I was in a panic now so was going a long with it. Then he asked me to send my online pw : and then text it back to him with a space and "" cancel ''. I did this unfortunately. Then he sent me a "" new account '' and asked me to do a wire transfer of the balance. He said this is the quickest way to protect my funds. I was concerned and asked if I could verify that he was actually Wells Fargo. He gave me his name and employee number but I should have hung up and called back. I carried on and approved the wire transfer. He then said it would take about 24 hours but usually takes less than that. I hung up. 
Feeling uncomfortable I told my husband what happened. He soon started getting calls from "" Wells Fargo '' and they were trying to confirm with him some charges on his debit card. The person seemed to have access to our online banking and our last four digits of our debit card. He said the phone "" dropped '' or ended. So he decided to go in to a branch and they confirmed that it was all a hoax and the wire was still pending so they were able to cancel it.

"I have disputed fraudulent charges made on my account on XX/XX/XXXX after I noticed the fraudulent charges that took place on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I told the Wells Fargo Claim representative VERY CLEARLY, that my phone and wallet were both stolen while I was out, my email was also hijacked hence why the email on the account has now been changed. My number was retrieved but my phone and wallet are still stolen. 

Wells Fargo denied my initial dispute claiming that these charges were not fraudulent and I in fact made the charges a few days later. 

I then went to the CFPB to receive my funds back. I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating "" Claim XXXX was filed when we were informed that multiple unauthorized transactions posted to your account. Our claims department reviewed this matter and found the transactions were performed by you or someone with your authorization. Consequently, your claim was closed on XX/XX/XXXX. 
We have reviewed your claim information and we agree with the decision previously communicated by our claims department. There were multiple successful logins to your Online Banking session during the timeframe of the disputed transactions were performed indicating you were aware of the transactions posting to your account. 
Additionally, some of the disputed transactions were verified via email. Based on the above information, we are unable to pay your claim. 
While we realize the information provided may not alleviate your frustrations, we hope this letter serves to clarify Wells Fargos action about this matter. '' As I stated initially to the Wells Fargo Claim department when disputing the transactions as fraud, MY PHONE and wallet were stolen. The person who stole these items most likely used my phone and was able to access my email and all my bank accounts from the mobile apps. 

The response I received from XXXX at Wells Fargo is inaccurate and Wells Fargo completely disregarded what I initially told them over the phone when disputing my transactions. 

This will be the last attempt I try to retrieve my stolen funds before hiring an attorney.

"I applied for this CITI Card in 2008 and on the contractual document amended the language to show that after the initial 0 % for 12 months the 9.99 % interest rate would vary only with prime rate.

They used every sneaky trick in the book to get me to accept points, or 0 % but never did to maintain that 9.99 % interest rate. But it appears this company has gotten sneakier and less professional over the years.

A consumer will file additional complaints if the issue remains unresolved an account ( s ) /tradeline ( s ) continue to be reported without maximum possible accuracy.

Thus Wells Fargo knows or has reasonable cause to believe they information they continue to furnish to the CRAs is false/misleading/inaccurate.

Then when I logged in that's went I saw the {$3900.00} wire transfer to some company I dont know. I asked if I can go ahead and change the password the person told me no and to wait 24 hrs. That's when I got to thinking why would a banker tell me that I can't update the temporary password. So I changed it any way Hung up on them and called The real Wells Fargo to report what just happened immediately. I'm disappointed that Wells Fargo would say in your letter "" Our research shows the transactions were made through a secure online banking session. By you or someone who had your authority and that No other processing errors occurred based on this information we determined the transactions were authorized. That statement is not true. I feel that you all did NOT research my account correctly. I've been with you all for 10 yrs not to mention I was with yall when yall was Wachovia. I don't use my savings to send any XXXX that should been a red flag if you researched my account. I also I don't use your wire services either with the exception of 1 time to pay my Rent to XXXX XXXX that went to a XXXXXXXX XXXX  in XXXX in the amount of {$1300.00} only because I was ill and could not make it into the branch to get the cashier 's check that I get every 15th of the month. I also like to mention that my account was not accurately reviewed, all my XXXX contact recipients are phone numbers not email addresses with the exception of 1 which was back in XXXX to company called XXXXXXXX XXXX  to order a cake. This is a major inconvenience that was my income tax money that I finally received was taken out of my account with out my authorization. Those funds were part of my savings to buy a house.I had to close all my accounts including my kids accounts. I also filed a report for identity theft.

"I had a small business that failed. I had a company credit card that all employees used. It was my fault that employees took advantage of my business in this way by making liberal and unauthorized purchases on the credit card. But, this was a business credit card, not a personal credit card and Chase Bank is treating it as a personal debt when it was not a personal debt. I feel that if this will affect me personally, then the employees that used the credit cards should be affected personally also. 

After I sold the assets, the business paid or settled the remaining open debt balances. This business Chase credit card is being attached to my personal credit report even though I never signed a personal guaranty for the credit card. Chase Bank harassed and called me daily to pay the balance on the credit card back in 2020. Since it was affecting my personal ability to move on in life and have access to credit again, I offered Chase a settlement. I paid the amount we settled on personally and they were supposed to remove the record from my personal credit report.

"Im writing this complaint to express my frustration of the conduct of these banks, trying to take advantage of me, by filing a Foreclosure lawsuit against me on a secondary/balloon loan they implied with my primary mortgage co. in XXXX with them. These Banks then in XXXX advertised on the radio that they were holding a 1-Day seminar on mortgage loan modifications to reduce interest rates drastically on the spot which they held at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I & several other Homeowners were selected, and in fact, had our interest rates & monthly payments, reduced with our maturity dates extended & approved by them on the spot, which they also guaranteed they would file required paperwork to the XXXX XXXX Recorders office. It was just brought to my attention on Thursday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX that they did not file all required paperwork to the XXXX XXXX XXXX office on secondary/ballon loan as they should have & guaranteed. However, they did file required paperwork to XXXX XXXX XXXX office for primary loan only! Mind you both loans & modifications were done at the same time again by these banks, therefore Im taken aback by the fact that they arent taking accountability for their errors & mistakes. It seems as though they did this purposely. 
I trust this is not the way the banks wish to conduct business with valued, loyal customers. I have been with these banks since XXXX. This has affected several Homeowners & is probably a worldwide issue. I have contacted the Attorney Generals Office, it was advised to contact CFBP as 1st step into having my issue investigated & Im trying to be an advocate for us all to stop these banks from trying to take advantage of Homeowners with equity in their homes so they can make even more money off of us who have worked so hard to pay our loan payments, and keep our homes to have a roof over our heads. I am most annoyed & dissatisfied with their conduct, due to the fact that I have been paying my reduced monthly payment of {$130.00} with interest rate of XXXX XXXX under modified maturity date of XXXX since effective date of XXXX until XXXX ( Lender ) unexpectedly discontinued taking automated payments from my checking acct. due to incorrect maturity date in their system. XXXX XXXX indicated to me in XX/XX/XXXX that my loan has been put into foreclosure status despite the fact that its due to the negligence of the Banks & I have tried several times to resolve this issue, but to no avail, its obvious that I did not cause this situation.

"I closed my accounts with Citibank on or around XX/XX/2023. I was able to consolidate two separate accounts over the phone. I was told over the phone that checks for the remaining balance for both accounts, one with {$300.00}, and one with {$3800.00}, would be mailed to my address and should arrive in ~10 business days.
