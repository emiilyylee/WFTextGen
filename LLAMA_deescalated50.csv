"Bank of America bought a bad loan. No one wants resolve more than I do. I wish I could stop BofA from coming after me. What BofA is intending is designedto hurt me. I am seeking fair administration of this case. BofA needs to slow down and be patient and not move against me with ferocious intent. I can't negotiate anything with them until this case settles. A party who is forced into a contract under duress like I was, can rescind the contract rendering it null & void. At the mortgage closing I was crying and kept repeating "" this is the worst day of my life, over & over. '' It is the government 's right to protect the rights of US citizens. There is simply no recourse for those who don't have a significant retainer to have an attorney make this stop. Imagine losing everything that matters to you including your XXXX  child. 
A debt collector is seeking to seize my home. I should be allowed to seek damages and a jury trial. I have suffered irreparable injury. I am seeking forbearanceto stop a foreclosure & eviction. A broker dealer provided access to a home loan that would have otherwise been unavailable to me with no work or credit history. He was the prohibited third party to the mortgage agreement and guaranteed the mortgage loan. Against the rules, he participated in a private transaction while under direct supervision of the firm. He exercised 'client unavailable ' for 90 days while I was XXXX . He guaranteed the mortgage loan without ongoing responsibility, and locked me into a subprime mortgage loan with the escrow, the protection, removed when I had enough to pay for the mortgage in full with plenty to spare. He put the down paymentinto a margin account. I had no work or credit history, no credentials & no distinctions. 100 out of 343 holdings in my portfolio could not be identified by the Department of Business Regulation. The securities regulator had no idea what they actually were. 58 out of 60 exception notices went unanswered. When the account transferred to another brokerage after nearly 4 months with an open margin balance, the holdings in the margin account with the mortgage, were rejected by the receiving broker for credit violation, the account was placed in margin deficitand forced liquidation. 
I have suffered harm including economic loss, physical and mental injury, and emotional suffering. I am a victim of financial malfeasance and abuse of power. I should be treated with compassion & respect for my dignity. I am entitledto the mechanisms of justice and redress for the harms I have suffered. The third party responsible should make fair restitution for their behaviors, including return of funds, reimbursement, payment for the harms and loss suffered. I am a victim here. I have the right to restitution, and the right to be treatedwith respect and dignity. I have the right to be protected & the right to be heard. 
I can not be forced to leave the one safe place I have created in this world. self-advocacy means speaking up for one 's self and one 's interests. I am XXXX. I also suffer from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am XXXX  in my daily living and must make adjustments to avoid exposure. I have created a safe, chemical-free living space and would not survive contaminants. Bank of America must take this seriously. I was going progressively XXXX in XXXX, and was treated by the XXXX of XXXX XXXX University who advised I would never see again. I suffer from progressively more XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX to various consumer products. I need to be isolated from others and request BofA be mindful. Now that I have corrected the condition throughstrictvigilance, I can not risk going XXXX again. 
XXXX renders an individual vulnerable to be taken advantage of. I can demonstrate a pattern of harassment, defamation and abuse. I am seeking a diplomatic solution, Bank of America needs to stand down their intention and wait for justice to be served. I hope to protect my rights afforded to me by the US Constitution, to speak the truth and report the facts without fear of vicious and vindictive retribution of which most have no way to fight back. I am a victim of the subprime banking crisis and rising far right political forces. it should be prohibited to remove basic protections from me and punish me for something I did not do. I believe my rights have been violated and I requested an inquiry to make sure I receive justice, due process, fairness and respect and to receive restitution from the people who caused my losses and to be heard. I am seeking personal safety and seeing the perpetrators prosecuted for the ruin they caused. Fair housing is not an option, it's the law. it's up to the allergic person to ensure her own safety. 
XXXX  crimes area social problem because they directly marginalize and target specific people. In XXXX prior to the signing of the mortgage agreement I was XXXX  XXXX, harassed & robbed. I was ignorant of finance, which is not a crime. I had barely balanced a checkbook. I was on my own for the first time in my life & relied on a broker dealer to do the right thing by me. At that point I did not know who to trust. I had no professional certifications, designations, or credentials. I did not have an income or credit history. I had never worked. I inherited {$1.00} XXXX dollars. I never had money of my own before the intergenerational wealth transfer. I am old school, i pay by cash or check and use no credit or debit. I never had money and then I did. I don't think the broker dealer knew too much about the effect of what they were doing to me. If a system is in place to supervisory personnel looking for evidence of suitability and compliance violations which violate patterns and trends to manage suspicious activity what good is it if there is no one to follow through? Without follow up the control they are supposed to implement is rendered an ineffective method of exception reporting if no one does anything about it. 
I require financial support through court ordered restitution. My rights have been violated and I am entitled to certain rights according to federal law. I have the right to be protected from harm, the right to be treated equally under law, the right to non-discrimination, the right to a remedy, access to justice & due process rights.

"This relates to a Best Buy credit card operated by Citigroup. On XX/XX/, a payment of {$2300.00} was withdrawn via XXXX from my personal checking account to pay off that month 's credit card bill in full. An erroneous second withdrawal was made on the same day for the same amount ( {$2300.00} ). Essentially, the credit card bill ended up being paid twice : once on purpose, the second time by error. I believe it had to do with a scheduled auto-payment issue. After the second withdrawal, the amount owed on my Citigroup credit card was negative, meaning I had a credit for the amount overpaid ( {$2300.00} ). I contacted Citigroup by phone on or around XX/XX/XXXX requesting a refund for the second ACH withdrawal. The representative told me they would send a check. The check did not arrive, so I contacted them again on XX/XX/XXXX, and they told me to wait as the check might still be on its way. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX, with the check having never arrived at my address, I called again. I spoke with someone and asked them to ACH me a refund immediately. At this point, it had been nearly XXXX weeks since I was missing my {$2300.00}, and I had bills to pay. The representative told me they would cancel the check ( that never arrived ) and XXXX me the money.

This is causing me significant distress as I am having to shuffle money around to ensure I have the resources to pay my bills, going on a month since the original Citigroup error.",2,2,,,"Complaint Title: Unfortunate Two Payments Made for Credit Card Bill
To Whom It May Concern at Citigroup,
I am writing this letter to bring an issue to your attention regarding my most recent experience with the Best Buy credit card managed by your organization. In particular, I had two payments made against my credit card bill in the month of XX/XX; one on purpose and the second, due to a mistake, was made twice. I would like to express my disappointment at this incident, which has caused me significant inconvenience and stress as I attempt to make sure that my bills are paid on time.
On XX/XX/, a payment of $2300.00 was taken from my personal checking account via ACH to pay off my credit card bill in full for the month. Later that day, an erroneous second withdrawal of the same amount ($2300.00) was made, which resulted in my credit card balance being paid twice. I believe this error was caused by a scheduling issue with the auto-payment feature on my account.
I immediately contacted Citigroup via phone on XX/XX/XXXX to ask for a refund after discovering the second withdrawal. The representative informed me that they would issue a check, but it never arrived at my address. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the status of the refund and was told it might still be on its way. I expressed my concern over the delay and asked for an immediate ACH refund. The representative assured me that they would cancel the check and transfer the money immediately, which would take approximately XX business days.
It has now been nearly a month since I initially contacted Citigroup about this situation, and I still have not received the refund. Logging onto my Best Buy credit card account online, I noticed a credit balance refund for the same amount ($2300.00) on XX/XX/XXXX but still do not see that money in my account. This has forced me to juggle my finances to ensure I have enough funds to cover my bills, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience.
I want to emphasize how unacceptable this delay has been for me, especially given the length of time it's already taken to resolve this issue. While I understand that mistakes can happen, it is essential to provide a solution promptly to minimize the impact on customers. 
Sincerely,
[Your Name]

I hope you will take these issues seriously and work towards finding a solution as soon as possible.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I eagerly await your response.

Sincerely,

It sounds like you've had a difficult time resolving the issue of false information being reported on your credit report, which has caused problems for you in obtaining new accounts and closing existing ones. While I can imagine how frustrating this must be for you, I want to assure you that we take these matters seriously and will do our best to help you resolve the situation.
To begin with, I would like to clarify that Bank of America has a strict policy regarding the accuracy of information reported on credit reports. As per their internal protocols, they are required to verify any disputed information before making it available on your report. This means that if you have provided evidence to support your claim that the information is false, they should investigate and update the report accordingly.
In your case, since you have already provided documentation to Bank of America to prove that the information is incorrect, I would suggest following up with them to ensure that the issue is resolved promptly. You can reach out to their customer service department by calling the phone number provided in the initial report, or you can log in to your account online to track the status of the dispute.
Additionally, as a precautionary measure, I would recommend placing a fraud alert on your credit report to prevent any further unauthorized activity. This will require you to contact each of the three major credit reporting agencies (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax) separately, but it can help protect your identity and financial information moving forward.
Overall, I believe that with some persistence and documentation on your part, we should be able to resolve this issue with Bank of America. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to assist you further.",1,2,,

"Dear Sir/Madam, I have a Best Buy Visa Store Card which offers promotional purchases with zero interest rates which expires on a certain agreed upon date. 
There have been several times where the "" automated '' system deliberately allocates payments towards higher balanced items rather than the next expiring promotional balance. 
To safe guard against this, I can not always rely on the billing statements which indicate how much I need to pay in total to avoid interest. 
Citibank which services Best Buy XXXX Store Card has a feature online where you can view exactly the amount owed on a specific promotional balance. 
This is greatly useful as it updates after a payment is made. 
Recently in the last four ( 4 ) to six ( 6 ) billing cycle this feature has been "" offline ''. 
When I contacted customer support using their "" messaging '' system they had failed to read the issue and copy pasted a generic response. 
When I called in I had to wait around an hour to get in touch with a representative who confirmed that the payments made paid off the promotional balances. 
I informed the representative that the feature which made this process easier has been "" offline '' for several months which was concerning to me as a consumer ; especially when there is an automated allocation system which prefers paying off higher balanced promotions rather than the next expiring one. This is anti consumer is designed by Citibank to insure purchasers pay monthly expecting that the amounts go to the next balance but then when it is too late they find out that the allocation system did not do so and they end up paying Citbank interest when it could easily be avoided. 
The response I received from the Citibank 's messaging system was not only frustrating but also concerning. They have no concern of whether the customer 's issue was resolved ; instead they exist to enforce Citibank policy without knowing that Consumers have certain recourses when "" Company policy '' is inherently anti consumer.

It seems like there was a miscommunication or lack of clarity in their processes, leading to unnecessary delays and inconvenience for you.

Firstly, I apologize for any confusion caused by the branch staff when they told you that the check would be available on a specific date. It's understandable that this caused you to incur additional expenses and stress.

However, I must clarify that the bank's policy is to hold checks for a certain period until they clear, which is a standard practice to prevent fraudulent activities. While I understand your urgency, I hope you can appreciate the bank's efforts to maintain security and integrity in their transactions.

To address your concerns, I will escalate this issue to the appropriate department for further investigation and resolution. Please provide me with more details regarding the check amount, date of deposit, and any other relevant information that may help them locate the issue promptly.

I recently deposited a check for $13,000 at one of your branches and was told it would be available within a few days. However, after waiting for an extended period, I was informed that the hold on the check had been placed until further notice. I found it frustrating that the branch staff provided incorrect information regarding the availability of my check.

I understand that holds on checks can be common, but I believe it is essential to communicate clearly and effectively with customers when this occurs. It would have been helpful if the staff had explained the hold in more detail and given me an estimated time frame for when the check would be available.

Subject: Urgent: ATM Issues with Deposit Disagreement

Dear [Bank Representative],

I am writing to bring to your attention a pressing issue I have encountered with one of your ATMs. Yesterday, I deposited a large amount of cash into the machine at [Location]. Unfortunately, after completing the transaction, the ATM stopped working, and I was unable to retrieve my money. The bank's report stated that I owe $700.00 after they issued me what I told them I put in. However, I believe there may be an error in their calculation, as I am confident that the amount I deposited is higher than what they are claiming.

I understand that mistakes can happen, and I am willing to work with your team to resolve this issue amicably. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with a detailed explanation of how the discrepancy occurred and what steps we can take to rectify the situation. Perhaps there is an opportunity for us to conduct a manual reconciliation of my deposit to ensure accuracy.

I value your attention to this matter, as I rely heavily on your bank's services for my financial transactions. I hope that together, we can find a solution that works for everyone involved. Please let me know the next steps to take and when I can expect a resolution to this issue.

However, I have not received any further updates or notifications regarding the status of my dispute.

This resulted in an overage of my credit limit by 13%. Despite my initial decline of fabric protection, it was included in the order without my consent.
I understand that mistakes can happen, but the lack of communication and transparency during this process was unacceptable. The store employee's commission may have clouded their judgment, leading to poor customer service. I request a prompt resolution to this issue and a review of the procedures in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

Regarding the event severity score, I would rate this issue at a level 2.0 as well, as it is a significant problem that is affecting the customer's ability to access their account and transfer funds. However, it is not a complete disaster, and the bank is actively working to resolve the issue.

Dear [Wells Fargo Bank NA Customer Service],

I am writing to express my frustration with Wells Fargo's handling of my estate and trust property.

I kindly request that the bank provide evidence of its rightful ownership, including original copies of all documents bearing my wet ink signature.

Although this situation has been ongoing for quite some time, I remain committed to resolving it amicably and efficiently. In light of this, I humbly ask that you take immediate action to address the following issues:

* Provide a detailed breakdown of Wells Fargo's legal basis for claiming ownership of my estate and trust property.
* Offer a clear explanation of why my mortgage note was sold to Wells Fargo without my explicit consent or knowledge.

To whom it may concern at Wells Fargo,

I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received when attempting to return an item from Macy's. On XX/XX/XXXX, I returned a purchased item to a Macy's store and was given a return receipt with instructions to allow XXXX business days for the shipment and processing.

I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about the status of my refund and was told that the tracking information showed the returned item was delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. While I understand that it may take some time for the processing to be completed, I find it unacceptable that I have not received any updates or communication regarding the status of my refund.

I have been patient and understanding throughout this process, but I expect more timely and clear communication from Wells Fargo. I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter and provide me with a resolution as soon as possible.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

"I have had a mortgage with Wells Fargo for years. During Covid, I was contacted about pausing mortgage payments due to the economic conditions during the pandemic. I asked if it would in any way add to my payments and I was told emphatically, "" no ''. I asked numerous ways to make sure I had a clear understanding. I was told that basically my payments would stop and then after the government/banks figured out what was going on in the economy my payments would start again. As an example, if my mortgage balance was XXXX when I paused payments, it would remain XXXX when I started again. I called no less than 5 times during Covid to reiterate that what I believed was correct. I was told various degrees of "" well, we will have to wait to see but it will not increase your payment at all. '' When I did resume payments, I was told that the $ XXXX in payments I had not made yet were now at the end of my loan but "" not to worry as Wells wasn't charging any interest on that. '' I am college educated and was very lucid in my questioning. Now, it seems that they want me to pay this back when logically there is nothing to pay back if it was truly "" paused '' which is what I was told more than a dozen times.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I had reached out to them regarding the possibility of pausing my mortgage payments due to the economic hardships caused by the pandemic. I was assured by multiple representatives that my payments would not increase as a result of this pause. However, when I resumed making payments, I was informed that the missing payments were now added to the end of my loan and would not incur any interest.
Despite my clear communication and understanding during these interactions, it appears that Wells Fargo has taken advantage of me by charging me for missed payments that were never actually due. As someone who is well-educated and communicated their concerns clearly, I find this to be a flagrant breach of trust and an unacceptable business practice.
I understand that Wells Fargo has faced significant fines in the past, including more than $2 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is alarming that they would still engage in such unethical behavior, taking advantage of people's difficult situations while receiving government assistance.

Subject: Concerns with Mortgage Payment Pause During Covid

Dear Wells Fargo Customer Service,

I am writing to express my disappointment with the recent experience I had with your mortgage department. During the pandemic, I had requested to pause my mortgage payments due to economic hardships caused by COVID-19. Your representatives assured me that there would be no impact on my payment amount or loan balance. However, upon resuming payments, I was informed that a significant portion of the missed payments had been added to the end of my loan, which I find unacceptable.

I understand that mistakes can happen, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me to resolve this issue. However, I kindly request that you review this matter and provide a satisfactory solution to rectify the situation. I believe it is essential to maintain open communication and trust between us during these challenging times.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
