"I have a Bank of America Mastercard. Today, XX/XX/2023 our card was declined during a purchase for the 3rd time due to "" fraud protection ''. The purchase was for approximately {$22.00} and, again, our card was declined due to potential fraudulent activity. We live in XXXX and shop for groceries across the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We routinely shop at this store. Today I answered the call immediately and authorized the charge. Over half an hour later Bank Of America had not yet reactivated our card. I just spent over 45 minutes with customer service who could not transfer me to a manager. They can not explain why this is happening. We can not buy our groceries if our card is declined. We are humiliated when the card is declined for no reason. I want to see my contract so that I can take appropriate legal action and they will not send it to me.",1,1
"I used the Home Depot Credit card to make a purchase for my business in XXXX of 2023. In XXXX of 2023 my business tried to make a payment to this debt, and the check was sent back. My business Partner and I decided that I would make the payment from my own checking account and be reimbursed by the business. I made this payment in late XXXX after I was informed that the original payment was rejected. For some reason, This payment was applied to the wrong account. I called to fix this on XX/XX/XXXX and was assured that the {$200.00} payment that I made was applied to the write account. On XX/XX/XXXX I got another delinquent notice. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that the money was transferred but not applied to the amount due. While on the phone I was assured that the payment would be applied to the amount due and my next due date would be XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I got notified that a delinquent notice was put on my credit report. I called again and Home Depot said that it would take five days to get the payment applied to the amount due. I asked that the delinquent notice be removed from my credit report. After many calls, someone finally said that they had put in a request to have the delinquent notice removed from my credit report but that it would take 14 days. Right now my credit rating is XXXX points lower and I have to wait 14 days for it to change. This is frustration and I want people to know about this practice at Home Depot Credit Services",1,2
"Bank of America bought a bad loan. No one wants resolve more than I do. I wish I could stop BofA from coming after me. What BofA is intending is designedto hurt me. I am seeking fair administration of this case. BofA needs to slow down and be patient and not move against me with ferocious intent. I can't negotiate anything with them until this case settles. A party who is forced into a contract under duress like I was, can rescind the contract rendering it null & void. At the mortgage closing I was crying and kept repeating "" this is the worst day of my life, over & over. '' It is the government 's right to protect the rights of US citizens. There is simply no recourse for those who don't have a significant retainer to have an attorney make this stop. Imagine losing everything that matters to you including your XXXX  child. 
A debt collector is seeking to seize my home. I should be allowed to seek damages and a jury trial. I have suffered irreparable injury. I am seeking forbearanceto stop a foreclosure & eviction. A broker dealer provided access to a home loan that would have otherwise been unavailable to me with no work or credit history. He was the prohibited third party to the mortgage agreement and guaranteed the mortgage loan. Against the rules, he participated in a private transaction while under direct supervision of the firm. He exercised 'client unavailable ' for 90 days while I was XXXX . He guaranteed the mortgage loan without ongoing responsibility, and locked me into a subprime mortgage loan with the escrow, the protection, removed when I had enough to pay for the mortgage in full with plenty to spare. He put the down paymentinto a margin account. I had no work or credit history, no credentials & no distinctions. 100 out of 343 holdings in my portfolio could not be identified by the Department of Business Regulation. The securities regulator had no idea what they actually were. 58 out of 60 exception notices went unanswered. When the account transferred to another brokerage after nearly 4 months with an open margin balance, the holdings in the margin account with the mortgage, were rejected by the receiving broker for credit violation, the account was placed in margin deficitand forced liquidation. 
I have suffered harm including economic loss, physical and mental injury, and emotional suffering. I am a victim of financial malfeasance and abuse of power. I should be treated with compassion & respect for my dignity. I am entitledto the mechanisms of justice and redress for the harms I have suffered. The third party responsible should make fair restitution for their behaviors, including return of funds, reimbursement, payment for the harms and loss suffered. I am a victim here. I have the right to restitution, and the right to be treatedwith respect and dignity. I have the right to be protected & the right to be heard. 
I can not be forced to leave the one safe place I have created in this world. self-advocacy means speaking up for one 's self and one 's interests. I am XXXX. I also suffer from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am XXXX  in my daily living and must make adjustments to avoid exposure. I have created a safe, chemical-free living space and would not survive contaminants. Bank of America must take this seriously. I was going progressively XXXX in XXXX, and was treated by the XXXX of XXXX XXXX University who advised I would never see again. I suffer from progressively more XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX to various consumer products. I need to be isolated from others and request BofA be mindful. Now that I have corrected the condition throughstrictvigilance, I can not risk going XXXX again. 
XXXX renders an individual vulnerable to be taken advantage of. I can demonstrate a pattern of harassment, defamation and abuse. I am seeking a diplomatic solution, Bank of America needs to stand down their intention and wait for justice to be served. I hope to protect my rights afforded to me by the US Constitution, to speak the truth and report the facts without fear of vicious and vindictive retribution of which most have no way to fight back. I am a victim of the subprime banking crisis and rising far right political forces. it should be prohibited to remove basic protections from me and punish me for something I did not do. I believe my rights have been violated and I requested an inquiry to make sure I receive justice, due process, fairness and respect and to receive restitution from the people who caused my losses and to be heard. I am seeking personal safety and seeing the perpetrators prosecuted for the ruin they caused. Fair housing is not an option, it's the law. it's up to the allergic person to ensure her own safety. 
XXXX  crimes area social problem because they directly marginalize and target specific people. In XXXX prior to the signing of the mortgage agreement I was XXXX  XXXX, harassed & robbed. I was ignorant of finance, which is not a crime. I had barely balanced a checkbook. I was on my own for the first time in my life & relied on a broker dealer to do the right thing by me. At that point I did not know who to trust. I had no professional certifications, designations, or credentials. I did not have an income or credit history. I had never worked. I inherited {$1.00} XXXX dollars. I never had money of my own before the intergenerational wealth transfer. I am old school, i pay by cash or check and use no credit or debit. I never had money and then I did. I don't think the broker dealer knew too much about the effect of what they were doing to me. If a system is in place to supervisory personnel looking for evidence of suitability and compliance violations which violate patterns and trends to manage suspicious activity what good is it if there is no one to follow through? Without follow up the control they are supposed to implement is rendered an ineffective method of exception reporting if no one does anything about it. 
I require financial support through court ordered restitution. My rights have been violated and I am entitled to certain rights according to federal law. I have the right to be protected from harm, the right to be treated equally under law, the right to non-discrimination, the right to a remedy, access to justice & due process rights. I am seeking personal safety and seeing the perpetrators prosecuted for the ruin they caused. I can not be forced to leave the one safe place I have created in this world. What Bank of America is intending is persecution designed to hurt me. BofA needs to slow down & be patient and not move against me with ferocious intent. I can't negotiate anything with BofA until this case settles. This is an urgent plea to protect the status quo. I will not allowBofA to destroy my life. I require a controlled green living space. My sensitivities raise a bouquet of legal issues and require accommodation. I am seeking forbearance to stop foreclosure & eviction. Bank of America needs to ensure my rights and put my safety first. BofA needs to slow down their intention and wait for justice to be served.",1,3

"This relates to a Best Buy credit card operated by Citigroup. On XX/XX/, a payment of {$2300.00} was withdrawn via XXXX from my personal checking account to pay off that month 's credit card bill in full. An erroneous second withdrawal was made on the same day for the same amount ( {$2300.00} ). Essentially, the credit card bill ended up being paid twice : once on purpose, the second time by error. I believe it had to do with a scheduled auto-payment issue. After the second withdrawal, the amount owed on my Citigroup credit card was negative, meaning I had a credit for the amount overpaid ( {$2300.00} ). I contacted Citigroup by phone on or around XX/XX/XXXX requesting a refund for the second ACH withdrawal. The representative told me they would send a check. The check did not arrive, so I contacted them again on XX/XX/XXXX, and they told me to wait as the check might still be on its way. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX, with the check having never arrived at my address, I called again. I spoke with someone and asked them to ACH me a refund immediately. At this point, it had been nearly XXXX weeks since I was missing my {$2300.00}, and I had bills to pay. The representative told me they would cancel the check ( that never arrived ) and XXXX me the money. They informed me it would take XXXX business days for this to happen, which was an unacceptable amount of time to me, considering how long it had already been with Citigroup having my money. I asked to speak with a supervisor, XXXX, who told me the same thing. I escalated it further to XXXX who assured me it was unlikely to take that long and that she would put in a note to expedite/prioritize it. As of right now, XXXX XXXX XXXX I still have not received the XXXX. Logging on to the Best Buy credit card page, I see that on XX/XX/XXXX, there was a credit balance refund for the same amount ( {$2300.00} ), but I don't see that money in my account. This is causing me significant distress as I am having to shuffle money around to ensure I have the resources to pay my bills, going on a month since the original Citigroup error.",2,2
"I wanted to transfer a balance to my BOA credit card XXXX  using a balance transfer offer they sent me. It was for 11 months no interest with 3 % balance transfer fee. I called BOA to do the transfer and they said that if I opened a new BOA credit card XXXX, I could get 18 months no interest with 3 % balance transfer fee. I needed to make the transfer by XX/XX/XXXX. After opening XXXX, I learned that I had to wait 14 days before I could use it for bal. transfer, which would have been too late. I called BOA, but they said there was nothing they could do, so I told them I did not need the new XXXX because it was a higher interest rate than the 2 BOA credit cards I currently had. I told them to cancel XXXX, I would do the balance transfer on my XXXX. I went online and submitted my balance transfer using XXXX and checked on it a few days later. I found out that BOA canceled XXXX ( 18 % interest ) and kept open XXXX ( approx 21 % interest ). I called BOA customer service again and they heard the conversation where I said to cancel XXXX and keep open XXXX and said they would reinstate the card, so I could use it for the balance transfer before XX/XX/XXXX. It did not happen, so instead of getting 11 additional months to spread out paying for approx. {$3000.00}, I paid off the balance, but still believed that BOA was going to reinstate XXXX. I received a letter approx. XX/XX/XXXX from BOA ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) saying "" We're sorry- we can't reopen your credit card ending in XXXX. ''",2,1

"Dear Sir/Madam, I have a Best Buy Visa Store Card which offers promotional purchases with zero interest rates which expires on a certain agreed upon date. 
There have been several times where the "" automated '' system deliberately allocates payments towards higher balanced items rather than the next expiring promotional balance. 
To safe guard against this, I can not always rely on the billing statements which indicate how much I need to pay in total to avoid interest. 
Citibank which services Best Buy XXXX Store Card has a feature online where you can view exactly the amount owed on a specific promotional balance. 
This is greatly useful as it updates after a payment is made. 
Recently in the last four ( 4 ) to six ( 6 ) billing cycle this feature has been "" offline ''. 
When I contacted customer support using their "" messaging '' system they had failed to read the issue and copy pasted a generic response. 
When I called in I had to wait around an hour to get in touch with a representative who confirmed that the payments made paid off the promotional balances. 
I informed the representative that the feature which made this process easier has been "" offline '' for several months which was concerning to me as a consumer ; especially when there is an automated allocation system which prefers paying off higher balanced promotions rather than the next expiring one. This is anti consumer is designed by Citibank to insure purchasers pay monthly expecting that the amounts go to the next balance but then when it is too late they find out that the allocation system did not do so and they end up paying Citbank interest when it could easily be avoided. 
The response I received from the Citibank 's messaging system was not only frustrating but also concerning. They have no concern of whether the customer 's issue was resolved ; instead they exist to enforce Citibank policy without knowing that Consumers have certain recourses when "" Company policy '' is inherently anti consumer. 
I have attached the following as evidence : Best Buy XX/XX/2023 statement ( See Exhibit A ) Citibank Customer Service message ( See Exhibit B ) Citibank feature which is no longer operating ( See Exhibit C )",2,1

'' ( Furnisher of information to credit agencies ) is a financial institution by definition under that title. 15 USC 1681 section 604 a section 2 states that "" In general Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.

"On XX/XX/2023, I made a purchase of 14 items with an online retail vendor for {$290.00}.

On XX/XX/2023, I made a payment of {$140.00} to my account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I promptly realized a mistake had been made and immediately contacted card services via the XXXX support line to request a cancellation of this charge. I was assured that the charge would be reversed. Consequently, I resubmitted the payment on the same day to my correct account at XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was successfully posted on XX/XX/2023. 

However, I was dismayed to discover that on XX/XX/2023, XXXX 's card services attempted to withdraw another {$140.00} from my now inactive account at XXXX XXXX XXXX. This attempt not only was unauthorized but also resulted in an overdraft fee of {$30.00} being debited from my account. 

Upon contacting XXXX 's card services, even after verifying the accuracy of the aforementioned transactions, I was informed that the charge on XX/XX/2023 ( which is not reflected on my account ) was authorized. I want to categorically state that this charge was not authorized by me and has resulted in financial damages amounting to {$30.00} at the time of lodging this complaint. 

Moreover, I am deeply concerned by the comments made by XXXX 's XXXX Services, indicating potential unauthorized attempts in the future. This raises significant security concerns and demands immediate attention. 

I kindly request the following actions to be taken : A thorough investigation into the unauthorized charge dated XX/XX/2023. 
Reversal of the {$30.00} overdraft fee incurred due to the unauthorized charge. 
XXXX that no future unauthorized attempts will be made on my account.

"I signed up for the Chase Bonvoy Marriott credit card XX/XX/2023. They were offering a sign on bonus. I was looking forward to getting the points for future stays at your hotels. If I charged {$3000.00} to the credit card in the first 90 days, they would give me XXXX certificates for free nights and one free night yearly. The Marriott credit card never arrived so I was not able to activate it or use it. They billed me {$95.00} for the annual fee immediately upon my signing up for the card and sent me a bill. It was not until I called them and asked where the card was, they informed me that my first bill was past due. I got them to send me a new card and started using it and immediately paid the {$95.00} bill. I charged {$3000.00} in the next XXXX months and waited for my Marriott bonuses to arrive in my Marriott Bonvoy Account. Unfortunately they never did. I then called your customer service and they said to call Chase. Chase said the {$95.00} did not count and therefore I was not eligible to get the sign up bonus as I was just under the {$3000.00} spend. I asked for a special exception as I was so close to the {$3000.00} and they said NO. So I asked for a refund of my {$95.00} and they said they couldn't give me that either. So I asked them to close my account since they did not provide me with the satisfaction and the performance of those terms according to the credit card agreement I then contacted Chase and after a few calls I was told I WOULD get my {$95.00}. After months of not receiving the refund back, I called several more times. The last time I called, I told them I felt like I was getting ghosted. They finally called me back on XXXX  and told me that they will not refund my {$95.00} because I did not close it according to their terms..

Since Marriott is promoting this card in all their Marriott locations, I would like Marriott to be part of this compliant also. Both will not refund my {$95.00} which I am due because they did not give me what was agreed upon sign up for the card. Chase is very cutthroat with their customers when you have an issue with their credit card. When you complain they close your complaint out in XXXX days and make a determination in their favor. If you complaint to the XXXX about them. They just respond and say you can't get a refund based on their policy. A representative told me I would get a refund and now even though they record all calls they can not find that particular recording. I want my {$95.00} refund.

"On Monday, XX/XX/2023, a Wells Fargo agent called me to inform me of suspicious activities in my account. He explained that he needed to verify certain transactions, and we went through each of the ten transactions individually. During this review, we identified three unauthorized withdrawalstwo of {$500.00} each and one of {$200.00}, all from non-Wells Fargo ATMs. The total amount of these unauthorized transactions was {$1400.00}. The agent asked me to confirm if my debit card was in my possession, but upon checking, I realized that I had misplaced it. When I informed him of this, he asked if I had allowed anyone else to use my debit card, to which I replied in the negative. 

As a precaution, the agent decided to deactivate my card and arrange for a replacement.

I vehemently explained that I had not authorized these transactions and reiterated the circumstances : the sale of my phone and the loss of my debit card.

"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX, Iowa XXXX Subject : Appeal Regarding Unsatisfactory Veterinary Service Dispute with Chase Freedom Card I am writing to appeal to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for assistance with a recent transaction dispute on my Chase Freedom card. The transaction in question pertains to a service provided by a veterinarian for the treatment of my dog and cat. The transaction took place on XXXX of XXXX with XXXX XXXX for amount of XXXX dollars. 

Briefly summarized, my pets were administered steroid injections by this new veterinarian with the expectation that it would alleviate their symptoms, including itching, swelling, hotspots, biting, and licking paws. Sadly, three days post-treatment, not only have their symptoms persisted, but they have also significantly worsened. 

Given the lack of improvement and the deteriorating health of my pets, I contacted Chase Freedom 's customer service to dispute the charge, hoping for an understanding and resolution. However, their approach towards the situation was unyielding. They suggested I consult another veterinarian and produce a statement that confirms the ineffectiveness of the previous treatment. While I understand the need for verification, I found this requirement burdensome and potentially inconclusive. A secondary veterinarian, without prior knowledge of my pets ' condition pre-treatment, would be ill-equipped to provide a definitive comparative statement. 

Furthermore, I inquired if Chase would bear the costs for this secondary consultation since it was a condition they imposed, but this was declined. It feels unjust that, in seeking redress for a service that was ineffective, I am compelled to incur further expenses, with no guarantee that they would be recouped. 

It is important to understand that my dispute is not based on mere dissatisfaction but the tangible worsening of my pets ' conditions post-treatment. It is disheartening that the resolution offered involves additional financial and emotional stress for me. 

I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene and guide this matter to a fair resolution. I genuinely believe that I should not be held accountable for charges related to services that not only failed to deliver their promised results but also led to further complications for my pets. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust in the CFPB 's mission to ensure consumers like myself are treated justly in financial dealings and look forward to your guidance. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",2,2

"On XX/XX/2023, my scheduled monthly payment date, I scheduled a one time only online payment for the balance of my credit card debt ; the actual balance for purchases at that time was XXXX dollars ; my one time only online payment was scheduled for that amount. 
I had previously established a XXXX dollar auto pay to be paid on the same day, this is an auto pay that I had established months ago and for many months, I have been paying my balance with that auto pay amount. 

Mistakenly I did not "" uncheck '' the monthly auto pay of XXXX dollars for the pay date of XX/XX/2023, consequently, Citi requested both the XXXX XXXX time only payment and the XXXX auto pay from my bank. The XXXX was paid but the XXXX auto pay was returned as insufficient funds. 

Due to a policy at Citi Bank, Citi created a debit balance for the XXXX dollar returned funds and today they insist that I must pay the XXXX "" outstanding balance ''. I have discussed this issue with Citi Bank Customer service on three occasions, explaining my position that the XXXX dollar "" debit '' is not supported by any purchases and that the balance of my account was paid in full with the {$9000.00} one time only scheduled payment. The XXXX dollar balance is nothing more than an accounting place holder and does not represent any funds spent nor does it represent any funds due. Citi charged their XXXX dollar returned funds fee three times and I paid those fees. 

After the several conversions with customer service representatives and their managers, I've been told that the balance stands and must be paid. Customer service reps nor their managers bothered to look at my account balances- they simply maintain that a returned payment represents a debit and that I am responsible for paying that debit. ( and the returned fund fee ) Citibank Credit cards create debit balances from mistaken attempts to pay off my credit card balance equal to the attempted or mistaken payment regardless if the mistaken payment attempt is represented by any purchases or previous balance. 

After a month of arguing about the unfounded balance they closed my account and are demanding the XXXX dollar fake balance be paid. 

I am seeking to have the XXXX fake balance be recognized for what it is, an accounting place holder and be credited from my account balance.

When contacted by the Citi fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX through their early fraud warning system, I was asked whether our card was in our possession. I explained to the caller from Citi that we did have at least one card in our possession, but that this was our previous Citi Thank You Card, not the new upgraded Citi Premier cards wed recently requested. 

In fact, the new Citi Premier cards hadn't arrived through the mail in a timely fashion, leading us to now believe that they may have been intercepted and used for the fraudulent charges. 

I have filed a police report with the XXXX Police Department and can provide you with the report number if needed. 

Yet, according to a letter we received from Citi dated XX/XX/XXXX, Citi has closed the investigation of these charges and is holding us responsible, citing that we had the cards in our possession. I have called twice in the interim to again explain that the cards in our possession at the time of the fraudulent charges were our previous Citi Thank You cards and not the Premier cards that were yet to be received through XXXX mail. 

Note that Citi did determine that two charges taking place on XX/XX/XXXX were indeed fraudulent, and is not holding us accountable -- making it puzzling that they did not determine the fraudulent charges on XX/XX/XXXX as related. 

Pertinent to Citi 's investigation, we also received a bill from XXXX for a fraudulent charge which appeared related to one of the disputed charges ( we are not XXXX customers ). XXXX quickly investigated, verifying that the charge was indeed fraudulent, and has notified the credit bureaus on our behalf. We have provided this information to Citi. We have also provided the XXXX Police Department police report. 

Please let us know if you need any further information from us to assist in asking Citi to reopen the investigation and reconsider their decision.

"Bank of America opened a credit card account in XXXX of XXXX  without my knowledge or permission. They used a XXXX party that resulted in a hard pull on my credit report and they haven't corrected it even after I brought it to their attention. 

I received a credit alert from my existing accounts that I had applied for a credit card. Since I hadn't applied for credit I initially believed this was an identify theft situation and I locked my report and asked Bank of America to correct my report. 

Only after a significant amount of time and reading stories about how Bank of America was opening accounts without customer permission did I realize what had taken place. 

I have multiple personal and business accounts with Bank of America so this remains shocking that that they would do this to me.",2,2
"Not quite sure but somehow, my credit card account was changed from regular postal mail to paperless billing. Because I check my email rarely only when I expect email, I was not aware of the bill and was charged two months of late fees and interest. On XX/XX/XXXX, Citi finally sent me a postal notice saying that my account was past due and I quickly paid the balance of the charges once I received the letter on XX/XX/XXXX. I also figured out the issue and was able to stop electronic billing. However, because of that I had two months of late fees and finance charges. I was able to get the finance charges waived after speaking with the CSR, but could not get the late fee waived.",2,3
I noticed my Chase account had been charged {$16.00} for an Amazon XXXX account for the last 17 months. I didnt notice initially cause I thought it was our Amazon account but my husband informed me that he pays for our Amazon account with his credit card not our debit account. I contacted Amazon for more information and found out it isnt our account at all but I was being charged for it. We checked if friends or family use the account but nothing. I contacted chase and let them know what I discovered. They made claims for all of the money that was taken fraudulently. They informed me today that they wouldnt be returning my money because it was over 60 days old. They would only return 3 payments. I would like the rest of the money that was stolen from my account ; {$220.00}.,2,2
"Dear Sirs : I wish to bring your kind attention to the enclosed documents for my safety deposit boxes at Wells Fargo XXXX location, XXXX. 

I have been your long term customer for last XXXX  years. You can verify on top of both the safety deposit Boxes agreement, XXXX XXXX Manager of Wells Fargo signed stating that the boxes are given to us for free for life so long as we have our accounts with the Bank. 
We went through different store Managers, at this location, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and other XXXX, who have been reversing the box fees. The fee was first charged and then removed as per the explanation given to us by all previous managers ( an arrangement required for the banks paperwork sake ). 

I have been in communication with Wells Fargo business line of communication executive office and I am not getting anywhere and there is no understanding after producing proof of free boxes by your Manager.

I would really appreciate your offices help and getting this issue fixed asap and we should not be charged for these two safety boxes so long we bank with Wells Fargo.

Awaiting to hear from your office soon. Please make sure that the charges levied towards the boxes have been removed and hereafter we do not have to encounter any further issue in future with the new store managers at this location.

We have been your customer and we would like to continue doing business with your bank unless we are forced to leave due to poor customers service. 

Appreciate your taking valuable time in going through the documents. 

Thanking you, XXXX XXXX",2,2

"We switched our Home Mortgage Insurance provider from Homeowners of XXXX to XXXX back in XXXX. The Homeowners of XXXX issued us a check for {$3500.00} which I cashed and on XX/XX/23 put via local Wells Fargo branch to our escrow account as additional escrow ( we have a receipt ). Then I checked and could find the above amount on my account, so I wrote a letter to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage with my concern. In their response they confirmed that the additional escrow amount was received in XXXX, went to unapplied funds first but on XX/XX/XXXX was credited to our escrow account. However, in XXXX we received the XXXX Account XXXX dated XX/XX/23 with notification our escrow account has a shortage of pretty much the same amount, and we need to pay it as additional escrow ( again?! ) or they will split it over or monthly mortgage payments. I called their Customer Service immediately to talk to their loan officers, but they were unable to clarify anything just saying like "" we can not understand what happened to the amount we received ''. We suspect our fund mismanagement if not fraud and it is very hard to deal with Wells Fargo nowadays- they put all services on the phone, it is hard to get a paper trail, every time new person responds ( same with letters ).",2,3
"Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally dispute a late payment entry on my credit report, specifically pertaining to my credit card account with the details mentioned below : Account Name : BANK OF AMERICA Account Number : XXXX Account Type : Credit card Responsibility : Individual Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Status : Paid, Closed Status Updated : XX/XX/XXXX Balance : N/A Balance Updated : N/A Recent Payment : N/A Monthly Payment : N/A Credit Limit : {$6500.00} Highest Balance : {$7000.00} Terms : N/A Payment History : XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Current / Terms met : 30 Past due 30 days : XXXX Payment history guide : 30 days past due as of XX/XX/XXXX Balance Histories : XX/XX/XXXX : {$33.00} Scheduled Payment : {$33.00} Paid : {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX Additional info : As of XX/XX/XXXX, your credit limit/high balance was {$6500.00} Contact Info : Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX TX XXXX Phone Number : ( XXXX ) XXXX I wish to bring your attention to a 30-day past due notation from XX/XX/XXXX, which I believe has been inaccurately reported on my credit profile. I want to emphasize that I have made full payment towards this credit card account, and I possess the necessary evidence to support this fact. 

According to the provisions outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1637 - Open end consumer credit plans ( C ) Payments at local branches. 
If the creditor, in the case of a credit card account referred to in subparagraph ( A ), is a financial institution which maintains branches or offices at which payments on any such account are accepted from the obligor in person, the date on which the obligor makes a payment on the account at such branch or office shall be considered to be the date on which the payment is made for purposes of determining whether a late fee or charge may be imposed due to the failure of the obligor to make payment on or before the due date for such payment.

To substantiate my claim of full payment, I am prepared to provide documented proof, which includes a copy of the payment made at the Bank of America branch, as well as any other necessary documentation that demonstrates the complete repayment of my debt. Additionally, I possess video evidence of the transaction that took place at the bank branch.",2,2
"On XX/XX/2023, I submitted a payment of {$640.00} from a checking account ending in [ ask if needed ] which had XXXX XXXXXXXX on it to Citi Bank to pay my balance and keep my account funded. After a few days, I recognized a Return Check Fee. Confused to why that would be I would call Citi Bank for the first time on XX/XX/XXXX inquiring about the fee and why. The person on the phone did not explain the fee after I constantly asked why and I asked to get it waived which they agreed to do, I just had to wait until my statement posted on XX/XX/XXXX. Waiting until XX/XX/XXXX I would call Citi again as I noticed that another returned check fee appeared again. This agent wasnt informed on what it was either and once again said that when my statement is posted, they will reverse it and my account will be reflected to show the proper balance. So I wait until the next day where I receive an email saying a Replacement Payment is required. So I call Citi to ask about that as well as with an agent on the phone saying my account is fine all I have to do is make a payment. I used my account Ive been using with Citi to make payments to make a payment of {$680.00} which XXXX XXXX confirmed on a call I had with them minutes prior that they see the payment and it will be released, everything is all set. Hours later, I check my Citi account is closed with no notification after being strung along for a week and lied to before the account was randomly closed after taking a {$680.00} payment from me verbally after going through their verification process on each call. 

I reached out to Citi Executive Response Unit to explain the situation and they made a case to investigate it under the case number [ ask if needed ]",2,2

The customer service agent said there wasnt any changes to the claim yet but to wait to get a response on the XXXX of XXXX. I called today and the customer service agent said the case was closed and they didnt find any extra cash in the ATM, therefore denying me the missing {$2000.00}. I asked for details they found on the camera and she was not able to verify what the verification process was. She stated that sometimes they cant tell by looking at the camera. They also claimed they didnt find any extra cash while auditing. She did open a new claim to see if Bank of America will reconsider the case. No financial relief was offered and no detailed reason as to why the cash was not accounted for. This is not the first time this has happened with this bank/ location.

"I noticed and reported fraud on my Bank of America credit card on XX/XX/2023 while the transactions were still in a pending status. 

There was two charges ( one for {$930.00} and another for {$790.00} ) from Spirit airlines that were not authorized by me. I have never done any business with this airline. 

Bank of America investigated my claim and provided a partial reversal of the fraudulent charges, {$930.00} was reversed and the rest was not. 
They also provided partial documentation from Spirit airlines advising me that I received services and am responsible for the {$790.00} charge. 

I contacted Spirit airlines and they would not investigate this matter since Bank of America had to initiate this process. They were able to send me some documentation of how the airline ticket was purchased along with an email and phone number that did not belong to me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to appeal Bank of Americas decision and was advised I had to start a new claim/dispute as the initial claim was closed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested an email or mailing address to submit a formal written complaint and their representative XXXX from Arkansas advised they do not have one and I can only proceed to file a complaint with her over the phone. 

I do not understand how one charge was considered fraudulent and the other valid since the same person/contact info processed both transactions. 
Bank of America did not thoroughly investigate these fraudulent charges and my credit score has been negatively impacted due to carrying a balance of this credit card.",3,3

Despite providing substantial evidence, including a police report filed with the XXXX XXXX XXXX Sheriff Department on XX/XX/2023, and security camera footage verifying the fraudulent transactions, Wells Fargo dismissed my claims without any credible justification. 

This denial is not only unacceptable but also in violation of my rights under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) and Regulation E, which mandate that I am entitled to a detailed written explanation for the denial of my dispute claims. Wells Fargo 's failure to provide this explanation is a direct infringement of these regulations. 

I demand immediate action to rectify this situation, including a thorough investigation into Wells Fargo 's dispute resolution process. Failure to address this complaint will leave me with no option but to seek further legal recourse. 

I expect prompt attention to this urgent matter.",3,2
"Hello, I am writing to bring up a case of negligence in handling a wire fraud incident that I fell victim to. I believe that inadequate procedures and actions have led to the loss of a significant amount of my funds and have caused considerable distress to my family and me. 

On XX/XX/2023, I was targeted by fraudsters who impersonated our title company and deceived me into wiring {$87000.00} from my Wells Fargo checking account to a fraudulent account at XXXX. The fraudulent nature of the transaction came to light the following day, prompting me to report the incident to Wells Fargo immediately. I also took further action by filing a complaint on ic3.gov. 

Following the incident, both Wells Fargo and XXXX were engaged in the investigative process. XXXXXXXX XXXX  Wire Fraud Department not only verified the presence of the precise amount within the fraudulent account but also ascertained that the said account had been promptly frozen on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, a representative from XXXX 's XXXX branch confirmed the frozen status of the account to me and conveyed that it was slated for closure within 30 days, assuring me that the funds would be returned to me within this timeframe. Despite these confirmations and assurances, the subsequent course of actions have been markedly disappointing. 

Regrettably, I must inform you that Wells Fargo has taken a concerning stance. They are currently refusing to provide me with assistance by sharing the findings of their investigation, despite my exercise of the right to documentation. The information contained within this document, coupled with the statement from the Wells Fargo banker regarding his communication on the frozen status of the account, holds critical significance for my pursuit of repayment from XXXX. 

Despite my proactive efforts and cooperation, the situation has escalated into a complex ordeal, where not only the mishandling of the wire recall process by XXXX has resulted in severe financial and emotional consequences, but also Wells Fargo 's reluctance to provide necessary information further exacerbates the distressing circumstances. 

I am seeking your intervention in this matter to address the negligence displayed by both Wells Fargo and XXXX. The disregard for proper procedures and the mishandling of the wire recall process have resulted in the loss of our hard-earned savings and an overwhelming sense of injustice. 

I kindly request that your office investigate this incident thoroughly and bring the unjust bank practices to light. Additionally, I am seeking guidance on potential avenues for recovering the wrongfully released funds, including any assistance your office may be able to provide in cooperation with relevant authorities. 

Thanks, XXXX XXXX ( P.S. I am happy to provide any necessary documents that I have regarding communications that I had with XXXX and Wells Fargo to assist in this investigation )",3,3
"My bank account was hacked and my debit card was used for numerous transactions without my knowledge, I was also overcharged by merchants I had done business with in the past, I informed the bank of the stolen debit card and phone and asked for account to be locked down until I could review my account and figure out why I was being charged.

After he received the codes he told XXXX that he would enroll him and me in fraud protection so our future XXXX transactions wouldn't be compromised.

I unfortunately said yes to the text which ultimately approved the XXXX transaction to XXXX which he obviously never received.

the dispute was filed so long ago i dont recall each transaction or amount of each transaction but the disputed amount is for {$3100.00} and was filed all the way back in 2021 and my claim is still yet to be resolved. i've submitted all documentaion thats been requested from me and have called countless times as to the status of my claim and each time all they say is we can file a complaint on the timeframe of the claim but that obviously isnt dong any good because wer 're going on 3 years with no resolution to the claim,3,2
"Today, XX/XX/XXXX approximately XX/XX/XXXX I received several calls from a Wells Fargo number XXXX. It's the same number on the back of my debit card. The imposter wanted me to verify several charges that morning with my debit card. I did not make any charges that morning. He stated two charges in XXXX, Florida, one at a XXXX for about {$240.00} and one at an XXXX store for about {$1000.00}. I said no. While I was on the phone he said our account was also being flagged for a XX/XX/XXXXtransfer for {$500.00} to someone named XXXX XXXX. I said no that was not me. In addition he said someone transferred {$1700.00} from my checking account to my savings account. I was very concerned because this showed they had access to my online banking. He asked if my husband might have made the transfer. I said no. He said he would have to close the account and give me a new account to transfer my funds into. He said it would take about 2 minutes and put me on hold. It all sounded very professional and I was looking at my account and it looked like there was a transfer made without my knowledge of {$1700.00} into my savings account. So I was glad I thought the fraud department caught it before it got out of hand. Then he came back on the phone and said he had to lock my phone? Asked what phone company I use and I told himXX/XX/XXXX. I was in a panic now so was going a long with it. Then he asked me to send my online pw : and then text it back to him with a space and "" cancel ''. I did this unfortunately. Then he sent me a "" new account '' and asked me to do a wire transfer of the balance. He said this is the quickest way to protect my funds. I was concerned and asked if I could verify that he was actually Wells Fargo. He gave me his name and employee number but I should have hung up and called back. I carried on and approved the wire transfer. He then said it would take about 24 hours but usually takes less than that. I hung up. 
Feeling uncomfortable I told my husband what happened. He soon started getting calls from "" Wells Fargo '' and they were trying to confirm with him some charges on his debit card. The person seemed to have access to our online banking and our last four digits of our debit card. He said the phone "" dropped '' or ended. So he decided to go in to a branch and they confirmed that it was all a hoax and the wire was still pending so they were able to cancel it. 
I'm just writing because the whole ordeal felt like someone from within Wells Fargo was commiting this fraud. They had all the language and ability to get in to our account information.",3,3
"I have disputed fraudulent charges made on my account on XX/XX/XXXX after I noticed the fraudulent charges that took place on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I told the Wells Fargo Claim representative VERY CLEARLY, that my phone and wallet were both stolen while I was out, my email was also hijacked hence why the email on the account has now been changed. My number was retrieved but my phone and wallet are still stolen. 

Wells Fargo denied my initial dispute claiming that these charges were not fraudulent and I in fact made the charges a few days later. 

I then went to the CFPB to receive my funds back. I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating "" Claim XXXX was filed when we were informed that multiple unauthorized transactions posted to your account. Our claims department reviewed this matter and found the transactions were performed by you or someone with your authorization. Consequently, your claim was closed on XX/XX/XXXX. 
We have reviewed your claim information and we agree with the decision previously communicated by our claims department. There were multiple successful logins to your Online Banking session during the timeframe of the disputed transactions were performed indicating you were aware of the transactions posting to your account. 
Additionally, some of the disputed transactions were verified via email. Based on the above information, we are unable to pay your claim. 
While we realize the information provided may not alleviate your frustrations, we hope this letter serves to clarify Wells Fargos action about this matter. '' As I stated initially to the Wells Fargo Claim department when disputing the transactions as fraud, MY PHONE and wallet were stolen. The person who stole these items most likely used my phone and was able to access my email and all my bank accounts from the mobile apps. 

The response I received from XXXX at Wells Fargo is inaccurate and Wells Fargo completely disregarded what I initially told them over the phone when disputing my transactions. 

This will be the last attempt I try to retrieve my stolen funds before hiring an attorney. Wells Fargo states that we as the customers are "" NOT LIABLE FOR FRAUDULENT TRANSACTIONS '' although it seems very clear that I am in fact liable for fraudulent transactions as Wells Fargo is insisting to make me liable for this entire claim.",3,3
"I applied for this CITI Card in 2008 and on the contractual document amended the language to show that after the initial 0 % for 12 months the 9.99 % interest rate would vary only with prime rate. This line was truck form the contract before sending in. By creating the account citi agreed to these terms. And for 10 years they maintained that. However, just recently they raised the interest rate to 25 % and didn't inform me. 

They used every sneaky trick in the book to get me to accept points, or 0 % but never did to maintain that 9.99 % interest rate. But it appears this company has gotten sneakier and less professional over the years. 

It's no wonder Americas Financial Future is in Jeopardy when you have thieves like CitiBank. 

I am a 16 year customer and have held this card since then. So disappointed in this company.",3,1
"I was informed by Bank of America on XX/XX/2023 that there was fraudulent activity on my account. There were two charges for {$1100.00} totaling {$2200.00} and a bunch of small charges adding up to XXXX totaling the amount to {$2300.00}. After dealing with the claims department I received temporary credits for one of the {$1100.00} charges and all the small ones ( {$52.00} ) totalling {$1100.00} on XX/XX/2023 which are now permanent. There was no reimbursement for the other {$1100.00}. I called Bank of America 's claims dept and asked why I didn't receive a credit for the 2nd {$1100.00} and they said that whoever handled the claim made a mistake and that they were going to file a new claim for the missing {$1100.00}. On XX/XX/2023 a temporary credit was put in my account for {$1100.00} and then on XX/XX/2023 the {$1100.00} was taken back out of my account. I called Bank of America to find out why and the agent I spoke with said that whoever handled previous claim on XX/XX/2023 made another mistake by making a new claim and the back office saw it as a duplicate and reversed the transaction. This agent said she was going to make a new claim with notes saying that its not a duplicate and I was temporarily reimbursed for the {$1100.00} again on XX/XX/2023. Then on XX/XX/2023 the credit was reversed again because the back office thought it was another duplicate. Since then I have spoken with a number of agents trying to find out what it happening. Everytime I speak to them they say whoever handled it before made a mistake and they are going to fix it. They claim that they are reopening the original claim which started on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX have to wait another 45 days for an answer. I just spoke with them 18 days later and theres still no progress. I've been dealing with this since XX/XX/XXXX about 4.5 months. They've mishandled this claim and my money so many times I have no faith I will ever see this {$1100.00} again. No one at Bank of America has taken any responsibility for how poorly they have handled this claim and at the end of the day it's me who has to keep calling them to see whats happening. Usually to find out they messed up once again and all the can offer a "" sorry for your inconvenience "" apology. They need to be held accountable for mishandling this claim so many times.",3,3

"On or around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I filed two ( 2 ) CFPB complaints against Wells Fargo because Wells Fargo XXXX has never corrected its records regarding misapplication of a payment that led an account to be charged-off in early XXXX : XXXX and XXXX. Unfortunately WF XXXX has closed these complaints out claiming they are "" duplicate '' complaints from a complaint they responded to in XXXX of XXXX : XXXX. A consumer will file additional complaints if the issue remains unresolved an account ( s ) /tradeline ( s ) continue to be reported without maximum possible accuracy. Wells Fargo 's closure of the complaints implies that it is both familiar with the issue presented in my complaints. That is, Wells Fargo is aware they are furnishing the CRAs inaccurate information that alleges the last payment for the account was made on or around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, when a payment made on or around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX was misapplied causing the account to be charged-off. WF XXXX own records and notifications ( in attached docs ) clearly show the application of a XXXX dollar payment to the wrong account and the CO that resulted. Thus Wells Fargo knows or has reasonable cause to believe they information they continue to furnish to the CRAs is false/misleading/inaccurate. To try and resolve the matter WF XXXX paid off the account in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX to stop any future reporting. Nevertheless, WF XXXX failed to correct the payment history for the prior months. While XXXX removed the false/misleading payment history for the months preceding charge-off, XXXX has left the charge-off annotations and payment history that WF XXXX reported until it was XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX because WF XXXX continues to verify the account XXXX accurate as reported '' to XXXX. Thus, the remedies have been at best partial and the information that persists for this account/tradeline is false/misleading/inaccurate ( see Boggio v. USAA Fed. Sav. Bank, quoting Saunders v. Branch Bankin that is referenced in Twumasi-Ankrah v. Checkr , Inc. , 954 F.3d 938, 943 ( 6th Cir. XXXX ) ) and is patently unverifiable. By continuing to furnish the C/O narratives and C/O payment history to XXXX, or any CRA, Wells Fargo continues to engage in unfair practices under CFPA 1036 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) / 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( A ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and unlawful practices under 12 CFR 1026.13 because the misapplication of payment was not reasonably avoidable by me. WF XXXX misapplication of payment on its own has caused me harm. The harm is compunded by the fact that WF XXXX then failed to apply a forbearance and/or deferment correctly leading their accounting system to mark payments as "" late '' during periods when WF XXXX  billing system failed to generate bills which itself is a serious violation of 12 CFR Part 1026 TILA ( Reg. Z ) Even under the Section E.1 of the XXXX WF XXXX was required to send those billing statements during periods of deferment/forbearance. At this point I have cause to sue Wells Fargo under 15 U.S. Code 1681s2 for damages to recover direct losses, indirect losses, and emotional damage that has resulted due to WF XXXX continued willful negligence. All I am asking is for Wells Fargo to cease furnishing and/or verifying the the CO payment history to any and all CRAs, and to cease furnishing and/or verifying any/and all derogatory narratives to any CRA WF XXXX has supplied information for this account/tradeline.",3,3

"I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding an unresolved fraudulent transaction dispute that Wells Fargo has failed to remedy for over 60 days now. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX I discovered three unauthorized, fraudulent XXXX transactions were made from my Wells Fargo checking account ending in XXXX paid to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX name of XXXX XXXX XXXX The transactions totaled {$13000.00} plus fees and occurred between XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I immediately contacted Wells Fargo to report the transactions as fraudulent, as I did not initiate or authorize them. After filing a claim and providing the requested documentation, Wells Fargo reimbursed {$4000.00} of the stolen total. 

However, the largest single transaction for {$9800.00} remains under "" investigation '' with no resolution or return of my funds after over 60 days. I have made weekly calls and provided extensive proof, such as police reports and bank receipts, showing the recipient was an unknown third party. Yet Wells Fargo refuses to give a timeline or take any concrete action to reimburse this stolen {$9800.00}. All they continue to do is escalate my case to another party within the bank each time I call. 

As a loyal customer for over 25 years, I am incredibly disappointed with this lack of urgency, transparency, and reasonable resolution by Wells Fargo on a confirmed fraudulent transaction claim. {$9800.00} is a massive sum that I rightfully need to be returned to my account immediately.

I recently lost my father and I'm faced with financial burdens.

"On XX/XX/ I received a call from Wells Fargo to advise me of fraud on my account. Come to find out the person was an imposter. They said they were calling because they recived an alert about fraud on my account. They mentioned to be on a recorded line, and wanted to verify some transactions with me. However before proceeding they said they had to make sure it was me. I did not verify any personal information with them. The person sent me text messages and ask that I verify the one time code, which I did. Unfortunately I do not have those text messages as my phone deletes messages after so many days. He proceeded to ask me about transactions from somewhere in Texas which I declined that I did not do. I do have my call log still which I will be sending. Next after confirming the so called charges, the guy asked me about a Recipient for XXXX and I told the guy then I don't t know the person and he said he would remove it dor me and put in a dispute. Then he mention that he will be shutting down my debit card and sending a new one. Next he tells me about another transaction for a wire transfer and I'm like wait a minute hold up that's not me. I try logging into my account but couldn't get in. He said he was going to escalate and put in a ticket to stop the transfer. I was on the phone for over an hour with this person thinking they were helping me to protect my account. He gave me a temporary password to get back into my account because I was unable to log in while on the phone with them. Then when I logged in that's went I saw the {$3900.00} wire transfer to some company I dont know. I asked if I can go ahead and change the password the person told me no and to wait 24 hrs. That's when I got to thinking why would a banker tell me that I can't update the temporary password. So I changed it any way Hung up on them and called The real Wells Fargo to report what just happened immediately. I'm disappointed that Wells Fargo would say in your letter "" Our research shows the transactions were made through a secure online banking session. By you or someone who had your authority and that No other processing errors occurred based on this information we determined the transactions were authorized. That statement is not true.

"I had a small business that failed. I had a company credit card that all employees used.

"I had flooring installed with XXXX, and I agreed to finance the flooring through Wells Fargo since they were advertising a "" 24 Month No Interest '' promotion. Everything was good until 12 months after the flooring was installed, when I was suddenly charged interest on the full purchase amount of the flooring, over {$1000.00}. Needless to say I was surprised to see this charge. 

I contacted Wells Fargo about this immediately, and they said that it was actually a 12 month promotion and that I was mistaken, BUT they would waive roughly {$400.00} of the interest ( 15 % of it ) on the condition that I paid the entire balance on the phone immediately. They would not let me think about the offer and call back- it had to be right then and there, or no deal. I reluctantly agreed to do this, and submitted a payment for the entire balance of the account just to handle it and move on. 

After a handful of weeks I realized Wells Fargo had not taken funds for the balance of the account that I paid off, so I contacted them immediately. I confirmed with them that the payment information was accurate, and I had ample funds to pay for it, but they did not process the payment. The representative informed me that it was my fault that the charge didn't go through ( it wasn't ), and because I hadn't noticed within 72 hours, they were not going to honor the original agreement and I was going to be charged the full amount of interest. 

All of this feels like extortion - I don't think I should have to pay the interest at all since it should be a 24 month interest-free contract, not 12, and I've never missed or been late for an appointment at all. Even then, I still acted in good faith and tried to pay the account off in full, but the representative made a mistake, blamed it on me, and refused to honor the agreement we had the first time I called. This is all super frustrating and I've never been treated worse by a company.",3,2

"I applied for a new card and received it in the mail and activated it. As I was attempting to add the card to XXXX XXXX as it requests in the app as part of the setup steps it asked to verify by sending a text to the phone number on file. I selected that option and never received the text. I tried to have them call and never received the call. I then called in to have them add the card to XXXX XXXX where they requested to call a landline which I dont have a landline to receive the code. They asked to call back later to get a verification code which I did and they called me back on my same number using call waiting and added it to XXXX XXXX. The representative said the card was unlocked and the fraud block lifted. After making a couple purchases on the card it got marked with a fraud alert again. I called back in and they asked if I had another bank account with citi I could verify with as well as a bank account I use to pay Citi which I did not have added yet. The only resolution has been to send a letter to my mailing address which will take 4-7 or 7-10 business days depending on which Citi rep you are talking to. They are preventing me from using my card as agreed on and they have not been able to tell me at all why the card was flagged as they were normal purchases they asked about and now the fraud block requires a different verification. The citi fraud team has been entirely unhelpful and the methods of verification dont have anything to do with my identity another landline apart from the number I applied for the account with shouldnt be the only alternate route to verify and I can provide ID background info etc but they are not consistent with the options I have to verify from one call to the next. I have requested a supervisor and it has been a terrible experience so far working with them. Part of the reason I applied for the card is due to the bonus miles from using the card but I am unable to spend on the card to achieve the bonus without access to my actual card so it feels a lot like a bait and switch so far. 

My ideal resolution to this would be that they are able to verify my identity so I can use the card and not wait for verification through mail in 7-10 business days when I just received the card to the same mailing address within the last 3 days so another piece of mail sent just proves I am at that address recieving mail but I obviously am if I have the card in my possession and activated it when they sent it to that address.",3,2

On XX/XX/XXXX I got an email from my bank that my account was overdrawn, and it had a balance of - {$260.00} ( negative balance ). I logged into my Wells Fargo online bank account and found that there were 16 transactions made using the missing card on my account by someone other than me. I have never shared my pin code on my bank card with anyone ever. So immediately I called Wells Fargo Bank and reported my card was stolen. I was told on the phone by the banker that a new card was mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX, that I never received. Also, the banker cancelled my card as "" stolen '', sent out a "" new/replacement '' card and filed a report with the bank.

"On XX/XX/XXXX in the attached picture, I clicked on an ad which offered free samples of sunscreen. I was charged the shipping amounts below : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX CA {$5.00} XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX CA {$6.00} I made no further purchases with the seller. I left for a trip on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX and returned XX/XX/XXXX ( which I can provide flight information for ). I returned to find two additional unauthorized purchases for large amounts on my card, one apparently made on the day I was on my flight. The fraudulent seller kept my card information. I received no product or service. 

XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX CA {$120.00} XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX CA {$110.00} It has been nearly three months and I have not received a resolution. This is the first fraudulent incident I have reported to Citibank. Despite their written guarantee of protecting credit card holders against unauthorized purchases ( which states "" Youre protected against unauthorized charges on your consumer credit card account. At Citi, you will not be responsible for unauthorized charges ( charges which were not made by you, or anyone allowed to use the account ) ), they have withdrawn the credit to my account and I have spoken to a customer service representative who stated the act of providing my credit card information for the samples on XX/XX/XXXX meant that this fell under the 'scam ' and therefore not 'fraud ' category, despite the purchases being unauthorized. 

Additionally, I received a new ( different ) Citi card just five days ago and activated it. I had only made a single purchase before I found a new fraudulent charge posted today on this card : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX {$220.00} The Citibank representative told me that they had previously not provided the service that prevented ongoing charges from my old canceled card from rolling over to my new one! They suspected that a seller who had held on to my old card information now had made a new fraudulent purchase that simply rolled over, completely negating any point in canceling and obtaining a new card. This is absolutely unheard of to me and I can not imagine how an 'ongoing charge ' was established, for an 'XXXX ' no less, if the description is to be believed. They finally told me my next new card would have this service ( preventing rollovers ) and would credit this amount back to me. The admittance of this fraudulent activity and the denial of the previous one is completely contradictory.

"I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX from BOFA informing me of the account closure. I have paid regularly and am under my credit limit and have been a loyal customer since 2010. The email was so brief and weird - I thought the email was a hoax. I spent quite some time trying to get someone on the phone to figure out if I am the victim of some fraud. I finally did get someone on the phone and he was immediately very verbally abusive to me and told me, after placing me on hold multiple times for extended periods of time, that his supervisor would call me back. I felt like he was trying to provoke me into losing my cool as a means to use that against me in whatever BOFA is trying to do to me. I asked 'why are you canceling my account ' and he started yelling, 'do n't use 'you ' as it is not me and you are attacking me '. I told him - I meant 'you ' as "" Bank of America '' and this isn't about 'you personally '. He talked to me like we we were a couple in marriage counseling - not like he was a customer service representative there to resolve my natural confusion after such a bizarre email from BOFA. So he asked me to hang up so his supervisor could call me back. So, I did hang up and, after waiting quite a while with no return phone call from his supervisor, I called back and after multiple attempts, finally got someone else on the phone who began to yell at me, even telling me she would hang up if I spoke. I was trying to ask questions as I remained super confused, even concerned there was some fraud that provoked this whole drama, but since she insisted that my asking questions is 'talking over her ' and she would hang up if I 'talked over her ', I let her continue while I remained silent. After I let her yell at me for quite some time, I finally asked if I may ask a question, she said she would only answer maximum 2 questions - which she really didn't answer. She just berated me, yelling "" Bank of America WILL NEVER open an account with you again '' and told me that the company had sent me several letters and called me. None of that is true. Then, she hung up on me. So, I called back and after multiple attempts, I got someone on the phone who was actually very professional and courteous. She did confirm that BOFA never called or sent me a letter until that same day they sent this weird email - so she admitted that the previous representatives had made false statements on the telephone to me. She could not explain why they made this decision or what impact this would have on me. She did also agree it was weird that they did this since I have paid on time and been a customer for so long and am under the limit. I told her I do not appreciate the verbal abuse from the prior two reps, the false representations on the telephone about supposed attempts to contact me ( attempts she confirmed never happened ), and BOFA 's general lack of responsiveness or availability to discuss the matter after sending such a bizarre email. What do they expect? How do I know that this email is not the result of some fraud I don't know about? Isn't it natural that after receiving an email like that, I would call them and ask what happened? Why do they just hide and get verbally abusive when I finally get them on the telephone? I would like CFPB to ask BOFA why they did this to me, what this means in terms of them damaging my credit rating and/or demanding immediate payment of a balance and/or suing me or whatever else they may be inexplicably planning to do to me out of the blue with no warning. This whole drama caused me enormous emotional distress - I tried to explain that to BOFA and the first 2 customer service reps just upped the insults and the verbal abuse. It is totally weird and they should apologize for treating me in such a rude and unprofessional manner.",3,2

So anything that he books or slides his card for, goes to a reward account under him, and the same for me.

I received my XXXX bill with interest, so called in to make sure the promotion was in effect. I was told it was, but due to the terms of the balance transfer interest was charged on new purchases from the date of purchase instead of a traditional billing cycle. I said I was not told this, and they explained the agent had to go over these disclosures on the phone before allowing it to go through. It took two explanations from myself that it was not done with an agent but online before she said that I still acknowledged this would happen. 

I humbly admitted I'm sure did not read XXXX & XXXX 's of something like this before hitting "" Accept ''. I asked to be emailed a copy of what I signed. It was stated that it could not be provided. 

Now, at this point I decided would just use another card for regular purchases to completely avoid this in its entirety. However, tracking down the all the pieces the card was tied to was problematic. But when charges came through, I made immediate payments to clear those charges to ensure no interest would be charged. 

However, I am now learning that Chase has been applying my payments with significantly higher priority to my brand-new 0 % balance transfer instead of the purchases that I had made that would be accruing interest. In addition, you are not able to see how your payments are applied in this fashion until your next statement when that interest has already been accrued. 

For my XXXX payment of {$2300.00} to clear all non-balance transfer charges, {$500.00} of that was used towards the 0 % balance. This is clearly in an effort to force the consumer to pay interest on their purchase. At a XXXX, {$450.00} would be the needed amount paid by month to have a this {$5000.00} transfer paid off in the 11 months by its due date. To take even more than this is blatant manipulation of payment to force consumers to pay interest.",3,2
"THe bank of America closed my account completely without showing me the reason. A job scam happened to me by transferring {$350.00}. And this story. here is the story I know it later after the bank closed my account "" During the past two weeks, I was exposed to a fake recruitment on the XXXX program, where the name of a well-known company, resource-innovations, and the name of the human resources character, XXXX XXXX XXXX, was impersonated to talk to me as the one who hired When did you find out it was a hoax? On Monday, XXXX XXXX, I wanted, like every day, to open XXXX, because it was the means of communication between me and the human resources employee and the equipment seller on a channel called XXXXAt that time, I did not see the presence of the two channels and no trace of the talks. As a searcher for a better job, I found it a golden opportunity with all these benefits, so I entered the telegram, found the channel, and she spoke to me and said that she was XXXX, and she said I will interview you, and the interview was all about designing 10 questions. And I answered it. She asked me about my experience and the companies I had previously employed. And then she said give me half an hour to respond to you with our decision. Exactly half an hour later, the response was : Congratulations, you have been accepted into our team. She sent a list of hardware and software that I would need for remote work.Then she told me that you have to communicate with a channel on XXXX called XXXX XXXX, she said that he is the customer who will provide the devices, send him the list, and we will send you a check for {$3500.00}, as a deposit check. Print it, sign it and copy it in the bank, then send the amount to the seller. She sent me a check for the wrong amount in letters different from numbers, so I told her : She said I will send another. So she sent a new check. I put it in the bank and it was going to reach me on Wednesday at ten in the XXXXXXXX  said it will be late for you, do you have XXXXXXXX XXXX  I said yes. She said : Send it to the seller to send you the devices until the check arrives. I already sent the amount and XXXX sent me the receipt. On the second day : I found that my bank account was not opened at all. I called the bank and they said that they closed my account permanently. I talked a lot, and they did not say the reason. I went to the bank myself, they said there was a suspicious process and the check was withdrawn, so we closed it directly, and it will not be returned. I spoke with XXXX. She said : Didn't they say why? Long talk, I'm trying to shorten it. My history with banks is clean from XXXX  in XXXX, what is happening? I spoke to the XXXX XXXX about what happened. XXXX spoke to me. She said the check was withdrawn so that we can send you a direct amount to your account, and we will hold the bank accountable, because I told her that I was harmed because of you. She said we will solve the issue. Open an account in another bank. And I opened an account. And my exploitation containued that she would send you the devices. I told her that I do not have any money and that you must buy the devices yourself and send them to me. I began to have doubts, but it was the first time to work remotely. I was very happy with the job that would change my life, and I submitted my resignation from my previous job, and I really regretted that. 
What made me even more confident was when I asked the XXXX Employment Office if the company was real, and you said it looked like it. I am very sad about what happened. Especially when I was shocked by the complete disappearance of the channels, and they promised me that they would send me the equipment to work this week. Every day I used to sit in the morning and tell them good morning to be a regular and disciplined employee, but they deceived me. Too many details I can't write, I signed a contract with them and I will send everything I can keep here. '' In the end, the bank did not give me any opportunity to find out the reason for closing my account completely before I discovered the fraud, and I was not given the opportunity to explain and discuss it. I demand that the amount be refunded and that I be given credit.",3,3
"XX/XX/2023 at XXXX I got paid for work, for a job that I did via a XXXX payment in the amount of {$1000.00}, confirmation number : XXXX. The Payment ID : XXXX. I immediately got the notification & immediately logged into my XXXX XXXX Account, that has my Bank Of America account linked, to transfer the full {$1000.00}. It landed in my XXXX XXXX Credit Card instead of my checking account, because it was said that when I transfer from their end instead of Bank of America it can't go directly to my credit card. I contacted XXXX XXXX Credit Card customer service the next day when I noticed that issue. When I called XXXX XXXX, to request them to get understanding and then to request that they send the {$1000.00} to my checking account as it was intended to go to from the beginning, they said sure but they had to call Bank of America on three way to verify the funds were clear. We made the call, and on XX/XX/2023 the very next day Bank of America confirmed with XXXX XXXX that the funds were cleared as the day before, XX/XX/2023. XX/XX/2023, Bank of America was still using the {$1000.00} that was cleared XX/XX/2023, that I transferred on XX/XX/2023 immediately and the {$1000.00} showed up on my XXXX XXXX Credit Card same day right away. XX/XX/2023 Bank of America send an email ( that I didn't see until days later after seeing XXXX subtracted {$1000.00} from my account ) saying I didn't have enough money in my account. XX/XX/2023 XXXX XXXX sent a notification saying the "" funds transfer has been returned to XXXX XXXX '' from Bank of America to XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$1000.00} and said return reason was "" Insufficient Funds. '' We called on three way to try and handle the situation, Bank of America said I could add XXXX XXXX to the account so that I could transfer the money back to them, I tried to do it while they were on the phone and it said that I couldn't link the account both times that I tried although I've transferred before. So I took {$960.00} out of my Bank of America while on the phone and put it on my XXXX card, leaving {$39.00} in my Bank of America account and waiting until it cleared so that I could withdraw what was left and close the account. I then transferred that money immediately to my XXXX XXXX Checking ( I already had money in that account ). All this to say, Bank of America was double dipping in that money, causing XXXX XXXX to charge me an extra {$1000.00} on my credit card which also made my credit card balance be maxed out messing up my credit when I just got my credit to go up a lot of points, and because the "" changed their mind '' about my funds being cleared a day before and decided to hold on to those funds. The {$1000.00} was reversed from my checking and credit card. Also, I made a cash deposit into Bank of America in the amount of {$130.00} and immediately withdrew {$120.00} the same day. Bank of America has on my statement that I deposited {$130.00} on XX/XX/2023 and withdrew {$120.00} on XX/XX/2023, how is any of that even possible. Summary : I am demanding that money back for that bad mishandling of money and having me to have to lose {$1000.00} that I was saving, also, putting wrong dates of transactions, withdraws and deposits, changing dates. Causing all this stress for the past month, for me losing money to drive around not only to Bank Of America, but all the way from XXXX to XXXX NC to XXXX XXXX, losing money by transferring from XXXX immediately, causing my credit card to Max out, my credit score to drop points, printing out all of my transactions from my end, slowing down my process of having that money for a deposit on a place, potentially delaying my process of having a good standing relationship with my new credit card and more.",3,2

I also request Chase examine how this wire transfer was completed when the full name and account number ( with business name noted in the wire ) could not have matched the unintended recipients name, business name, and account number, and explain how wire transfers complete in violation of your policy ( per the Chase representatives statement below ) are addressed. 

By way of background, On XX/XX/2023, the following took place : I called XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX advised they could issue an amendment to rectify the issue. XXXX issued an amendment to the wire transfer at XXXX XXXX  XXXX suggested I reach out to Chase and notify Chase of the issue. 
I called Chase and spoke to a representative at XXXX XXXX XXXX. This Chase representative explained that if the information on the wire transfer did not match, the wire would be rejected. She stated it is Chases policy to verify that the name and account numbers match and to reject the wire if there is an error. In this case, the name of the intended recipient would not match the name of the unintended recipient. 

On XX/XX/2023, the following took place : I called XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX for an update. XXXX advised me that they had not received any communication or update from Chase and suggested that I reach out to Chase directly. 
I called Chase at XXXX AM EST and was informed Chase will not provide me any information about the wire because I am not the intended or unintended recipient. 
I reached out to the intended recipient, XXXX XXXX, and requested she contact Chase for an update. XXXX contacted Chase.

Chase informed XXXX that the wire had already been deposited into an unintended recipients account despite the wire information not matching. Chase does not provide her with any recourse. 
I call XXXX again to convey what Chase told XXXX and check the status of the amendment. XXXX informs me there is no update from Chase. 

Today, XX/XX/2023, the following took place : I called XXXX at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX for a status update. This XXXX representative issues a recall at XXXX XXXX based on yesterdays developments. 
I called Chase at XXXXXXXX XXXX informing Chase of the recall and asking for a status update. I am again told Chase will not provide me any information. 
XXXX called Chase and was not provided an update. 

I respectfully request the information noted in my first paragraph. Please note that I am not requesting the personal information of the unintended recipient or of XXXX XXXX, the intended recipient. I can be reached via telephone at XXXX or via email at XXXX.

"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and frustration regarding an ongoing issue with my Amex Citi Macy 's Credit account. Over the past three months, I have encountered multiple problems when attempting to make payments, and I have received inconsistent and erroneous information from your oversees customer service agents. This has significantly affected my credit and left me in a state of distress. 
The primary issue I have faced is with payment processing. On three separate occasions, I contacted your customer service department to make payments on my account. Each time, I was assured by XXXX customer service agents that the payment would be deducted from my account and promptly posted. However, to my dismay, the payments were not processed, and I received confirmation numbers that were essentially worthless. This left me with the false impression that my financial obligations were met when, in reality, they were not. 

Moreover, the situation escalated when I contacted your customer service department to rectify the payment errors. I was met with inconsistent and confusing responses from different foreign agents. Some of them claimed to have no record of my previous inquiries, while others were uncooperative and unable to provide a satisfactory resolution. It is incredibly frustrating to explain the same issue repeatedly, only to receive contradictory and unhelpful responses. 

The consequences of these payment issues have had a severe impact on my credit score. My financial responsibility and credibility have been unfairly damaged due to the inadequacies of your customer service department. I am deeply concerned about the long-term repercussions this may have on my financial stability and future credit opportunities.

"Wells Fargo claims i missed a payment in XX/XX/2020. They then proceeded to charge me late fees for 3 years because they counted the payments I was making at a month late instead of contacting me about the missed payment. They claimed to have called me, and provided me with a phone record. The phone number listed on the log is the company I am employed at. The team that answers the phone calls is under my supervision. No one at my work received a call looking for me. Not only am I on the company directory where they could have reached me, but the phone rings at my desk when an outside call is made. 
The only conclusion I can come up with is that because they did not ring through to the operator nor did they try contacting me on the phone tree. I was at work for nearly all of the times listed answering the phone at the number provided. If they would have asked if I was available to anyone at the company, I could have been reached. 
They also said that they were not authorized to call my cell phone despite it being listed as my home phone on the loan application ( which I am providing. ) They could not provide me with information telling me how I could have known or authorized the number that I put on my loan application. They provided this as evidence that I was contacted. I can not understand how the number I put on the loan application was not authorized to receive calls about that loan or how I could have been expected to know that it was not authorized. 
They were able to contact me through the postal system to let me know if a payment was short, but did not send me late notifications by mail. Because I was getting notifications when my payments were short, I believed I was caught up when I resolved these payments. 
The can and have contacted me in the mail. I did not receive any postal mail stating I was late in the entire 3 years they were charging me fees. 
Claiming that they did due diligence by trying to contact me only to tell me that they are not authorized to call me at the number on the loan application is not contact nor is it due diligence. Telling me that I was contacted by phone when I was not contacted by phone is a lie. Dialing and not talking to someone is also not contact. Would they do this on a home phone if my daughter picked up? State that they are not authorized to talk instead of asking if I was available so that was contact? 
What makes me most upset is that they have claimed to call when I received no call. I feel completely blind-sided by this and feel like the company has done nothing to lead me to believe that they didn't want this outcome.",3,3

Here is where the unresolved dispute begins : XX/XX/XXXX, citibank ( or maybe the merchant ) did {$2500.00} of chargebacks back onto my card. This was made of up 4 charges : {$1000.00}, {$930.00}, {$620.00}, {$23.00} XX/XX/XXXX, citibank ( or maybe the merchant ) did ANOTHER {$1000.00} chargeback onto my card. 

XX/XX/XXXX, citibank credited me for 2 of the chargebacks from XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} and {$930.00} XX/XX/XXXX, 3 random credits were applied to my account, ( I was told this was done by the merchant ) : {$5.00}, {$20.00}, {$20.00} XX/XX/XXXX, citibank credited me for the last XXXX chargebacks from XX/XX/XXXX : {$620.00}, {$23.00} They still owe me a credit for the {$1000.00} chargeback that was charged to my balance on XX/XX/XXXX. When you net this against the 4 random credits they have given me that have no offsetting charge ( totaling {$50.00} ) and combine that with 4 months of interest charges charged to me for short paying these fraudulent charges, it equals to my current balance which is {$1300.00}, none of which I actually owe to citibank. 

I have attached a spreadsheet that I've made which shows all of this charted out over time. Specifically, please take a look at the tab called "" charges vs credits '' and also the tab called "" sequential activity '' shows all of the charges in XXXX place with a running total on column XXXX I have also attached all of my credit card statements beginning with my XXXX statement when the initial problem started, all the was through my latest XXXX statement. 

On my personal spreadsheet that I have attached below, If you look at the tab called "" communication '', it details what I've been through with trying to work this out with citibank. Basically, it is the following cycle : - I call and explain the problem. The rep looks at my account and says that I've been given all the credits that I am due. I ask them to transfer me to their supervisor. 
- Supervisor comes on and either sees the problem and agrees to get this fixed, or in the last case, tries to tell me that the charges on my XXXX and XXXX statement were informational and did not actually go into my balance. A quick and simple mathematical calculation proves that to be untrue, in any case, they then transfer me back to customer service so they can actually credit the account. 
- Customer Service comes on and after explaining the problem again, they see the mistake but then they tell me that they don't have the authorization to make the credit, they will show this to their supervisor and the call ends. 
- Supervisor comes and takes a quick preliminary look at the account, decides that I've been credited everything that I am due, and closes the case. 

I have called and reopened the case many, many times. I am lost as to what to do. The last person I spoke with told me that they see the problem, and that I will be getting a letter showing that I have a {$1000.00} credit coming. That was 3 days ago and I haven't heard anything nor has my account been credited. 

My current balance due is made up of the following XXXX charges : {$1000.00} charged XX/XX/XXXX < $ XXXX credited XX/XX/XXXX < $ XXXX credited XX/XX/XXXX < $ XXXX credited XX/XX/XXXX < $ XXXX credited XX/XX/XXXX {$110.00} XX/XX/XXXX statement interest charge {$140.00} XX/XX/XXXX statement interest charge {$94.00} XX/XX/XXXX statement interest charge {$31.00} XX/XX/XXXX statement interest charge TOTAL : {$1300.00} I have emailed this breakdown to citibank on multiple occasions.",3,3
"I have an assumable loan and I called the number to talk to the department that handles assumption loans. NO calls or reps contacted me and can not call to speak to anyone but someone who takes numbers for call backs. Taking 7 business days when I was told it would be up to four business days. I have tried to have a supervisor call me and they have been "" messaged '' and they do not call back. I have filed a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked the Escalated Calls dept to help. Even that service center takes phone numbers for someone else to call back. Gets assigned in 24 to 48 hours and they often do not call back. But they "" resolve '' the case in 5-10 business days. Meanwhile, my house is not selling on the market this whole time. I have an assumable loan and this can help me sell. This is not timely.",3,3
"I used my credit card to purchase XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX size XXXX shoes from online vendor XXXX on XX/XX/2023, for {$220.00} through XXXX. After the purchase I immediately contacted my credit card company to rescind the purchase because I suspected fraud on the part of the vendor. This suspicion was based on other customers who complained online that the company never responded to their complaints after failing to receive purchased goods. My credit card company initially reversed my {$220.00} charge pending a fraud investigation. I followed up with the credit card company in writing on XX/XX/2023, that I never received the shoes, even though the vendor claimed to have delivered them to my residence via XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I learned about this so-called XXXX delivery not from the vendor but from the credit card company. The vendor never acknowledged receipt of my {$220.00} purchase via email, never sent me the XXXX tracking number, and I never received the tracking number from UPS even though I am a member of XXXX XXXX, which is supposed to deliver such notifications to me via text or email. I first received the tracking number from my credit card company more than a month after the package was supposedly delivered. When I tried to plug in the tracking number through the XXXX website, it wouldn't allow me to file a complaint about a missing package. In late XXXX my credit card company rejected my fraud claim for lack of evidence and posted the {$220.00} charge back on my card, even though I had also complained that I never received the shoes. So on XX/XX/2023, I wrote back to the credit card company demanding a full {$220.00} refund because I still had not received the shoes. I also emailed XXXX on XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX demanding a full refund and never got a response. In addition to the letters I sent I also had phone correspondence with the credit card company 's fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in which I complained about not receiving the shoes. Both calls to my knowledge were recorded. I am seeking a full {$220.00} refund because I never received the shoes I purchased.",3,3
"After reviewing my report, I noticed that this account is still on there, and it was supposed to be deleted. I further notice that the information that is reporting on there is incorrect and not accurate at all. 

Account was paid off in full, but they didnt state that it was paid. This account was to be completely deleted. It not showing not the report a few month ago Now it is back on was also supposed to be deleted. 

I have also noticed that it states that the company claimed this as a loss of assets which means they receive compensation for it and now its trying to make me pay again to receive double compensation which means this is a fraudulent claim.",3,3
"This complaint is number 16, I am re-filing my complaint because Wells Fargo is still refusing to answer to the questions in my complaint and refusing to investigate. Because AGAIN the previous contractor XXXX XXXX who is working from the comfort of their home without any supervision and are labeled XXXX, REFUSED to address my complaint and REFUSED to answer the questions in my complaint and IF they REQUESTED an investigation about this issue., they should have answers to my questions. ALL THIS XXXX DID ANSWERED ARE VAGUED that is why I am refiling complaint for the 16th time. This complaint is # 16 ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE, against the same branch manager and AGAIN Wells Fargo failed to respond PROPERLY, HONESTLY AND CLEARLY TO MY COMPLAINT AGAINST the BRANCH MANAGER WELLS FARGO 's XXXX lack of responsibility and lack of knowledge on how to deal with such issue is demonstrated by the response provided Wells Fargo here. The Wells fargo employees who are answering the complaint are working from the comfort of their homes without any control from a Wells Fargo management and without any supervision and the response of Wells Fargo here is null and demonstrates the unprofessionalism of the Wells Fargo XXXX employees and their disrespect to the customers and to the CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECTION DEPARTMENT. For that I re-filed a new complaint here hoping that Wells Fargo will open their eyes and ear to my complaint and do the necessary investigation and answer the questions in this complaint properly. and not telling me the answers to your question is a secret we can not share it with you and so is the invisible investigation. AND MY RESPONDING THAT THE BRANCH MANAGER CAN NOT ORDER AN ATM CARD AND CAN NOT INFORM THE CUSTOMERS THAT THEY CAN ORDER THE ATM CARD BY PHONE AND ONLINE!! Did the XXXX XXXX XXXX who answered the previous complaint # 11 about this issue really thought The customers would believe her previous answer to this complaint!! here is my complaint # 11 XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXXXXXX XXXX. was the first time I entered a Wells Fargo branch since XXXX. At my visit to branch # XXXX in XXXX, CA, I was the only customer at the branch. I found out that my ATM card was expired, I requested from the teller employee at the window to order my replacement ATM card, the employee requested help from the BRANCH MANAGER, who, after looking at my account, told me that he can not order the ATM card from his computer and that in order for me to order a new card, I MUST MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND SIT WITH A BANKER. He then proceeded to tell me that no appointments are available soon, but he can put me on a waiting list and get me to meet a banker faster than making an appointment. which I found it ODD because I have been with Wells Fargo for more than 35 years and I have renewed my ATM cards before at the teller window. Usually, they want you to sit with a banker to try to convince you to open more accounts that you do not need and to make investments that profit the bankers. I want from Wells Fargo answers to my questions, to verify if Wells Fargo is turning to a circus or is it still a financial institution 1- WHY THE MANAGER AT THE BRANCH TOLD ME THAT I NEED AN APPOINTMENT TO SIT WITH A BANKER JUST TO RENEW MY ATM CARD? It must be a hidden reason behind it that benefits the banker. 2- DOES THIS MANAGER THINK I AM XXXX  TO TELL ME THAT HE CAN NOT RENEW MY ATM CARD ON HIS COMPUTER? 3- HOW COME WHEN I WENT OUTSIDE OF THE BRANCH AND CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE , THE CUSTOMER SERVICE RENEWED MY CARD IN 30 SECOND PHONE CALL? 4- WHY THE MANAGER OF THE BRANCH DOES NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE AND DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO RENEW AN ATM CARD? 5- WHY THIS BRANCH MANAGER DID NOT TELL ME THAT I CAN ORDER THE REPLACEMENT ATM CARD ONLINE AND OVER THE PHONE? 6- IS WELLS FARGO HIRING MANAGERS FOR THE BRANCHES WITH NO EXPERIENCE SIMILAR TO THE ONES WHO ANSWER MY COMPLAINT AND THE ONE WHO TOLD ME HE CAN NOT RENEW MY ATM CARD ON HIS COMPUTER? 7- WHY WELLS FARGO IS REFUSING TO INVESTIGATE THIS POSSIBLE MISCONDUCT? I am not getting answers to my questions even after re-submitting my complaint more than 10 times in the last 4 months because Wells Fargo contracted the customer service duty to a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This company XXXX employes are without any banking experience to resolve the customer 's issues, Those employees are labeled ECMOs.are Working from the comfort of their homes without any supervision and NOT under the Wells Fargo management they are independent contractors. their responses are just a copy and paste of generic replies that they send to everyone or a vague response as the response I received for complaint # 10 The XXXX working from the comfort of their home Refused to address my complaint properly and they switch the case from a case against the MANAGER to a case against the window teller employee or about opening a new account or about checking and saving or about lack of appointments which I am not complaining about. Those Employees of the contractors XXXX, refused to forward my complaint to a REAL Wells Fargo manager, and refused to answer and investigate my complaint. I was told in writing by the Wells Fargo 's contractors XXXX that Wells Fargo has no email or website for online complaints and has no managers or supervisors and that was confirmed by the last response of the ecmo XXXX as they think they are the highest level in Wells Fargo or they are the XXXX ay Wells Fargo and no magers above them. So the Customers like me find no REAL Wells Fargo site to complain but here. Notice : because in my experience, Wells Fargo Employees do not tell the truth. You can reviews the security cameras at the branch to verify that the branch was empty of customers except myself and 4 tellers at the windows had nothing to do and the manager was telling jokes to the employees. XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXXXXXX XXXX What do you expect from this bank who does not even have an email address for their customer service in this XXXX Century! I WANT THIS COMPLAINT TO BE FORWARDED TO A REAL WELLS FARGO MANAGER AND NOT TO THE CLOWNS LABELED XXXX NOTICE : NO PHONE CALLS ARE ACCEPTED ALL RESPONSES MUST BE IN WRITING EMAILS OR MAIL BECAUSE IN MY EXPERIENCE, THE WELLS FARGO EMPLOYEES DO NOT TELL THE TRUTH.",3,3
