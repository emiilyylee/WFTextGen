Dear Wells Fargo Customer Service Team,

I am writing to express my frustration with the handling of my credit card dispute. After bringing this issue to your attention over a year ago, I have not received any resolution or communication from your team. Despite leaving multiple messages for the two representatives I was assigned, XXXX and XXXX, I have only received a few responses that do not address the core of the problem.

I understand that mistakes can happen, but the lack of follow-through and communication from your team has left me feeling frustrated and ignored. As a customer, I expect more professionalism and respect in how my issues are handled.

Despite this negative experience, I still want to do business with Wells Fargo and appreciate your efforts to improve your customer service. Please look into this matter and provide a resolution as soon as possible. Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

Title: Disappointing Experience with Credit Card Dispute Resolution

Dear [Bank's Customer Service],

I am writing to express my disappointment with the experience I have had with your credit card dispute resolution process. Specifically, I am unhappy with the lack of communication and follow-up from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo.

Despite leaving multiple messages for them over the past [X] weeks, I have not received a response from either of them. The situation has been frustrating and time-consuming, and I feel like my concerns are not being taken seriously.

I had a dispute with my credit card that is now over a year old, and I believe XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo was aware of the issue because they were sold to Wells Fargo. However, the lack of communication and follow-up from their team has made it difficult for me to resolve the issue.

I understand that mistakes can happen, but I expect better communication and customer service from a reputable bank like Wells Fargo. I hope you can look into this matter and provide a resolution as soon as possible.

"I had flooring installed with XXXX, and I agreed to finance the flooring through Wells Fargo since they were advertising a "" 24 Month No Interest '' promotion. Everything was good until 12 months after the flooring was installed, when I was suddenly charged interest on the full purchase amount of the flooring, over {$1000.00}. Needless to say I was surprised to see this charge. 

I contacted Wells Fargo about this immediately, and they said that it was actually a 12 month promotion and that I was mistaken, BUT they would waive roughly {$400.00} of the interest ( 15 % of it ) on the condition that I paid the entire balance on the phone immediately. They would not let me think about the offer and call back- it had to be right then and there, or no deal. I reluctantly agreed to do this, and submitted a payment for the entire balance of the account just to handle it and move on. 

After a handful of weeks I realized Wells Fargo had not taken funds for the balance of the account that I paid off, so I contacted them immediately. I confirmed with them that the payment information was accurate, and I had ample funds to pay for it, but they did not process the payment. The representative informed me that it was my fault that the charge didn't go through ( it wasn't ), and because I hadn't noticed within 72 hours, they were not going to honor the original agreement and I was going to be charged the full amount of interest. 

All of this feels like extortion - I don't think I should have to pay the interest at all since it should be a 24 month interest-free contract, not 12, and I've never missed or been late for an appointment at all. Even then, I still acted in good faith and tried to pay the account off in full, but the representative made a mistake, blamed it on me, and refused to honor the agreement we had the first time I called.

Dear [Bank Manager's Name],

I recently had a disappointing experience with Wells Fargo's customer service, and I wanted to bring it to your attention. While I was excited about the ""24 Month No Interest"" promotion for my flooring installation, I was shocked when I was charged interest on the full purchase amount after 12 months. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and was told that the promotion was actually only 12 months long, despite what was advertised.

However, I was disappointed with the way the representative handled my inquiry. They were not willing to listen to my concerns and instead placed blame on me for not noticing the mistake within 72 hours. I found their response to be unhelpful and unfair. As a customer, I expect better service from Wells Fargo.

Title: Frustrating Experience with Wells Fargo's Customer Service
Event Severity Score: 1.0
Tone Severity Score: 3.0

Dear [Bank Representative],
I recently had a disappointing experience with Wells Fargo's customer service when I tried to pay off my flooring installation loan. Despite my best efforts to act in good faith and resolve the issue promptly, I was met with unhelpful representatives who refused to honor our original agreement.
After installing new flooring through XXXX, I agreed to finance the purchase through Wells Fargo's 24-month interest-free promotion. However, 12 months into the loan, I was unexpectedly charged interest on the full purchase amount, totaling over $1000. When I brought this to Wells Fargo's attention, they initially offered to waive a portion of the interest but insisted that I pay the entire balance immediately. Although I reluctantly complied with their request, I later discovered that they hadn't processed the payment, and I had to contact them again to confirm the accuracy of my payment information.
To make matters worse, the representative I spoke with shifted blame onto me for the payment not going through, despite my assurance that I had sufficient funds in my account. They refused to honor our original agreement and threatened to charge me the full amount of interest if I didn't pay immediately. Their uncooperative stance left me feeling frustrated and disillusioned with Wells Fargo's customer service.
While this experience has understandably left a sour taste in my mouth, I acknowledge that mistakes can happen, and I appreciate your efforts to resolve the issue. I kindly request that you reconsider Wells Fargo's original agreement and waive the interest charge entirely or offer a fair solution. Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

It is unacceptable that someone was able to deposit a check into my account without proper verification or authorization. I demand that you take immediate action to rectify this situation and protect your customers' accounts from such fraudulent activities in the future.

I would like to request that Wells Fargo reimburse me for any losses incurred as a result of this incident, including but not limited to any fees or interest charges that may have accrued due to the unauthorized deposit. I also expect you to take steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future, such as implementing more stringent security measures for mobile deposits and conducting regular audits of customer accounts to detect any suspicious activity.

Dear Wells Fargo Customer Service Team,

I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration regarding the recent events involving my online checking account. On [date], I deposited a check through the mobile deposit feature on your platform. However, someone else was able to withdraw all the funds without my knowledge or permission. This incident has left me feeling disillusioned with Wells Fargo's security measures and customer service.

Case/Event Severity: 2.0 (Mild Issues with Significant Impact)

I believe that this issue should be taken seriously, as it involves the safety of my personal financial information and assets. Despite speaking with a manager at my local branch, I did not receive any meaningful assistance or compensation for the loss incurred due to this negligent checking account opening. It is unacceptable that my identity was not verified through mobile check deposit, resulting in someone else withdrawing my funds without my authorization.

Tone Severity: 3.0 (Severe Tone with a Touch of Emotion)

I am disappointed and frustrated by the lack of response from Wells Fargo regarding this incident. As a long-time customer, I expect more thorough security measures to protect my personal information and financial assets. The fact that someone was able to deposit a check in my name without my knowledge or consent is alarming and highlights the need for improved verification processes.

Complaint:

I urge Wells Fargo to take immediate action to address these issues and prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. Here are some recommendations that I hope will improve your customers' experience:

1. Enhance Mobile Deposit Security Measures: Implement additional verification processes to ensure that only the account holder can deposit checks through mobile banking. This may involve using facial recognition software or other innovative solutions to prevent unauthorized transactions.
2. Provide Better Customer Support: Offer more comprehensive support for customers who have been affected by fraudulent activities. In my case, the manager I spoke with at the local branch was not helpful in resolving the issue. A dedicated team or hotline could address customer concerns promptly and efficiently.
3. Provide Financial Compensation: Offer reimbursement for any losses incurred due to this incident. This could include covering the amount of the deposited check and any associated fees or penalties.

Conclusion:

I hope that Wells Fargo takes these recommendations seriously and makes the necessary changes to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. As a valued customer, I expect more robust security measures and better customer support. I look forward to hearing back from you regarding the actions you will take to address these issues.

"I applied for a new card and received it in the mail and activated it. As I was attempting to add the card to XXXX XXXX as it requests in the app as part of the setup steps it asked to verify by sending a text to the phone number on file. I selected that option and never received the text. I tried to have them call and never received the call. I then called in to have them add the card to XXXX XXXX where they requested to call a landline which I dont have a landline to receive the code. They asked to call back later to get a verification code which I did and they called me back on my same number using call waiting and added it to XXXX XXXX. The representative said the card was unlocked and the fraud block lifted. After making a couple purchases on the card it got marked with a fraud alert again. I called back in and they asked if I had another bank account with citi I could verify with as well as a bank account I use to pay Citi which I did not have added yet. The only resolution has been to send a letter to my mailing address which will take 4-7 or 7-10 business days depending on which Citi rep you are talking to. They are preventing me from using my card as agreed on and they have not been able to tell me at all why the card was flagged as they were normal purchases they asked about and now the fraud block requires a different verification. The citi fraud team has been entirely unhelpful and the methods of verification dont have anything to do with my identity another landline apart from the number I applied for the account with shouldnt be the only alternate route to verify and I can provide ID background info etc but they are not consistent with the options I have to verify from one call to the next. I have requested a supervisor and it has been a terrible experience so far working with them. Part of the reason I applied for the card is due to the bonus miles from using the card but I am unable to spend on the card to achieve the bonus without access to my actual card so it feels a lot like a bait and switch so far. 

My ideal resolution to this would be that they are able to verify my identity so I can use the card and not wait for verification through mail in 7-10 business days when I just received the card to the same mailing address within the last 3 days so another piece of mail sent just proves I am at that address recieving mail but I obviously am if I have the card in my possession and activated it when they sent it to that address.",3,2,3.0,3.0,"Subject: Frustration with Citi Card Verification Process

However, the representative apologized for the inconvenience and told me that the card had been unlocked and the fraud block lifted.

However, after making a few purchases with the card, it got marked with a fraud alert again. When I called back to resolve the issue, the representatives asked if I had another bank account or landline number I could verify with. While I understand the need for verification, I find it unreasonable that I'm being asked to provide additional information when I already have an active card and have made legitimate purchases. It's frustrating that your team couldn't offer a more straightforward solution or explain why my card was flagged in the first place.

My ideal resolution to this situation would be a quick and efficient verification process, allowing me to use my card without unnecessary delays. I understand the importance of security measures, but it seems like an overkill to require multiple forms of verification when I've already provided accurate information for my account.

As a result, I am escalating this issue to Case Severity Level 2 due to its impact on my overall satisfaction with the bank.

Tone Severity: 3.0 (Somewhat Critical)

I understand that mistakes can happen, but the frequency and severity of these incidents are unacceptable. The fact that someone used my card without my permission and made transactions totaling over $2,200 is concerning, to say the least.

The incidents mentioned above have had a significant impact on my experience with Wells Fargo. While they were not catastrophic, they did result in financial losses and inconvenience for me. I expect more from a reputable bank like Wells Fargo, especially when it comes to securing customer accounts and protecting their personal information.

Complaint:

I am disappointed with the way my claim was handled by Wells Fargo's Claims department. Despite providing documentation from multiple sources, including a police report and confirmation from my local post office, the bank closed my claims without further investigation or assistance. When I called to inquire about the status of my claim, I was informed that there wasn't enough evidence to support my case. This is unacceptable!

Please provide me with a detailed report on how the fraudulent transactions occurred, what steps were taken to resolve the issue, and what measures are being implemented to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Furthermore, I would appreciate any assistance in recovering any losses incurred due to these unauthorized transactions.

Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,

I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with Wells Fargo's handling of my stolen bank card claim. Despite being a loyal customer for over 28 years, I have been met with lackluster service and uncooperative bank representatives throughout this ordeal.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Wells Fargo stating that my account had a negative balance of {$260.00} due to unauthorized transactions made on my stolen card. Upon logging into my online account, I discovered 16 fraudulent transactions totaling {$12.00}. Shocked and concerned, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo to report the theft and request a replacement card.

However, my experience with the bank's customer service has been nothing short of appalling. The first banker I spoke with was unhelpful and dismissive, telling me that a new card had already been mailed to me. When I provided evidence of the fraudulent transactions, they cancelled the stolen card and issued a ""new/replacement"" card without any further investigation or assistance.

Despite filing two claims with Wells Fargo for {$2200.00} and {$12.00}, respectively, the bank has yet to provide any meaningful resolution or support. When I inquired about the status of my claim, I was told that police reports and documentation from USPS were not considered sufficient evidence – despite the fact that these documents are directly related to the theft of my card.

I have since escalated my issue to multiple departments within Wells Fargo, only to be met with transfer after transfer or generic responses that fail to address my concerns. The most recent representative I spoke with informed me that my claim would ""remain closed"" and that there was nothing else they could do for me.

As a long-standing customer of Wells Fargo, I find this treatment unacceptable and frustrating. I expect better service from a reputable financial institution like yours. I urge you to take action in resolving my claim and recovering the funds that were fraudulently obtained using my stolen card.

I had only made a single purchase before I found a new fraudulent charge posted today on this card : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX {$220.00} The Citibank representative told me that they had previously not provided the service that prevented ongoing charges from my old canceled card from rolling over to my new one! They suspected that a seller who had held on to my old card information now had made a new fraudulent purchase that simply rolled over, completely negating any point in canceling and obtaining a new card. This is absolutely unheard of to me and I can not imagine how an 'ongoing charge ' was established, for an 'XXXX ' no less, if the description is to be believed. They finally told me my next new card would have this service ( preventing rollovers ) and would credit this amount back to me. The admittance of this fraudulent activity and the denial of the previous one is completely contradictory.

The transaction was from boa to XXXX XXXX base in united state.,3,2,3.0,3.0,"Subject: Concern about Recent Transaction Freeze

Dear Bank of America Customer Service,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the recent decision to freeze a transaction from my account. I understand that banks have strict policies in place to prevent fraudulent activities, but I believe there may be an easy solution to this issue.

Tone Severity: 3.0 (Somewhat Harsh)

Event Severity: 2.0 (Moderate Impact)

Background:
I recently initiated a transaction from my Bank of America account to another party's account, but the transaction was frozen due to the word ""XXXXX"" appearing in the message. As someone who relies solely on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for my income, I am concerned that BoA may be abusing their power and taking advantage of my situation. I have been a loyal customer for many years, and this incident has left me feeling frustrated and distrustful.

Complaint:
I kindly request that you look into this matter further and provide an explanation as to why the transaction was frozen in the first place. I understand that security protocols are in place to protect customers' accounts, but I also believe that there must be a way to resolve this issue without causing undue hardship for my financial well-being. Perhaps there is another solution or alternative method of verifying transactions that could be implemented?

Resolution:
I hope you can assist me in resolving this matter as soon as possible. If the freeze on the transaction cannot be lifted, I would appreciate it if you could provide an alternative solution to ensure that my financial needs are met. Your prompt attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Title: Frustrating Transaction Freeze - Urgent Assistance Required!

Dear Bank of America Customer Service Team,

I am writing to express my utmost frustration with the unexpected freeze on a recent transaction through your bank. As a dedicated customer, I expect seamless and efficient service, especially when it comes to transferring money between accounts. Unfortunately, I have fallen prey to Boa's automated systems, which flagged a legitimate transaction as suspicious and froze my account.

Event Severity: 1 (Mild Issue)

The transaction in question was from Bank of America to another legitimate bank account in the United States. However, due to an overly cautious automated system, the transfer was flagged and frozen, causing me significant inconvenience and worry. While I understand the need for caution, this issue is more of a minor hiccup than a major problem.

Tone Severity: 3 (Mildly Critical)

I hope you can understand my frustration with this situation. Although it's not a catastrophic issue, it's still causing me considerable inconvenience and stress. I appreciate your attention to this matter and expect a prompt resolution to get things back on track.

Body:

Could you please provide an explanation for the unexpected freeze on my account? As a customer who relies solely on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for my income, any disruption in my financial transactions can have severe consequences. I hope we can find a solution to unfreeze this transaction and ensure that future transfers go smoothly without such unnecessary interruptions.

Additionally, please take steps to address the glitches in your automated systems that are causing innocuous transactions to be flagged and frozen. This issue affects many customers like me who rely on these transfers for their basic needs. I trust that you will take this matter seriously and work towards finding a lasting solution.

Conclusion:

I hope you can understand the gravity of this situation and provide prompt assistance to resolve this issue. Please unfreeze my account and ensure that future transactions go through without any disruptions. Your prompt attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated, as it's causing me significant stress and inconvenience. Thank you for your time and consideration.

"I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX from BOFA informing me of the account closure. I have paid regularly and am under my credit limit and have been a loyal customer since 2010. The email was so brief and weird - I thought the email was a hoax. I spent quite some time trying to get someone on the phone to figure out if I am the victim of some fraud. I finally did get someone on the phone and he was immediately very verbally abusive to me and told me, after placing me on hold multiple times for extended periods of time, that his supervisor would call me back. I felt like he was trying to provoke me into losing my cool as a means to use that against me in whatever BOFA is trying to do to me. I asked 'why are you canceling my account ' and he started yelling, 'do n't use 'you ' as it is not me and you are attacking me '. I told him - I meant 'you ' as "" Bank of America '' and this isn't about 'you personally '. He talked to me like we we were a couple in marriage counseling - not like he was a customer service representative there to resolve my natural confusion after such a bizarre email from BOFA. So he asked me to hang up so his supervisor could call me back. So, I did hang up and, after waiting quite a while with no return phone call from his supervisor, I called back and after multiple attempts, finally got someone else on the phone who began to yell at me, even telling me she would hang up if I spoke. I was trying to ask questions as I remained super confused, even concerned there was some fraud that provoked this whole drama, but since she insisted that my asking questions is 'talking over her ' and she would hang up if I 'talked over her ', I let her continue while I remained silent. After I let her yell at me for quite some time, I finally asked if I may ask a question, she said she would only answer maximum 2 questions - which she really didn't answer. She just berated me, yelling "" Bank of America WILL NEVER open an account with you again '' and told me that the company had sent me several letters and called me. None of that is true. Then, she hung up on me. So, I called back and after multiple attempts, I got someone on the phone who was actually very professional and courteous. She did confirm that BOFA never called or sent me a letter until that same day they sent this weird email - so she admitted that the previous representatives had made false statements on the telephone to me. She could not explain why they made this decision or what impact this would have on me. She did also agree it was weird that they did this since I have paid on time and been a customer for so long and am under the limit. I told her I do not appreciate the verbal abuse from the prior two reps, the false representations on the telephone about supposed attempts to contact me ( attempts she confirmed never happened ), and BOFA 's general lack of responsiveness or availability to discuss the matter after sending such a bizarre email. What do they expect? How do I know that this email is not the result of some fraud I don't know about? Isn't it natural that after receiving an email like that, I would call them and ask what happened? Why do they just hide and get verbally abusive when I finally get them on the telephone? I would like CFPB to ask BOFA why they did this to me, what this means in terms of them damaging my credit rating and/or demanding immediate payment of a balance and/or suing me or whatever else they may be inexplicably planning to do to me out of the blue with no warning. This whole drama caused me enormous emotional distress - I tried to explain that to BOFA and the first 2 customer service reps just upped the insults and the verbal abuse. It is totally weird and they should apologize for treating me in such a rude and unprofessional manner.",3,2,3.0,2.0,"Sure, here's an example of a complaint for Bank of America that de-escalates the tone severity to 1.0 and the event severity to 1.0:

Title: Unacceptable Customer Service Experience with Account Closure

Dear [Bank of America Customer Service],

I recently received an email from your bank informing me that my account has been closed, and I am writing to express my disappointment and concern regarding the way I was treated during the subsequent phone calls. Despite being a loyal customer since 2010 and paying regularly, I found the communication style of the representatives to be unprofessional and abrasive.

During the first call, I was taken aback by the tone of the representative, who seemed to be deliberately aggressive and confrontational. I understand that there may have been a legitimate reason for closing my account, but the way it was communicated left me feeling frustrated and upset. The representative's demeanor did not provide any clarity or resolution to my concerns, and instead escalated the situation.

On the second call, I was met with even more hostility and verbal abuse. I find it unacceptable that the representatives would speak to me in such a manner, especially when I was only trying to understand the reason for the account closure. Their behavior was not only unprofessional but also caused significant emotional distress.

I appreciate the fact that you have acknowledged that there were no attempts to contact me and that the email may be related to fraudulent activity. However, I still wish to know what this means for my credit rating and any potential further actions your bank may take against me. It is only fair that I receive a clear explanation and resolution regarding this matter.

I kindly request that you take immediate action to address the issues I have raised here. I expect a thorough investigation into the behavior of the representatives who handled my calls, as well as a clear apology for their unacceptable conduct. In addition, I would appreciate guidance on what this account closure means for my credit rating and any further actions that may be taken against me.

I was confused and concerned by this message, so I tried calling the bank to get some clarity. Unfortunately, the customer service representatives I spoke with were not helpful or courteous.

Their behavior was unacceptable and left me feeling disrespected and upset. 
I would appreciate it if CFPB could investigate this situation and determine why BOFA treated me so poorly when I tried to address their concerns. Could they explain why they sent such a strange email without any warning or justification? How can they justify the abrupt termination of my account, especially since I have been a reliable customer for over ten years? 
I also want to know what impact this incident will have on my credit report and financial history. Will it negatively affect my score, or will there be any legal action taken against me as a result of their decision? If so, can they explain the reasoning behind such actions?

Title: Dispute Resolution Failure - Fraudulent Transactions on Wells Fargo Checking Account

Dear Wells Fargo Customer Service,

I am writing to express my frustration with the unacceptable service I received during the dispute resolution process regarding fraudulent transactions on my checking account. Despite initiating a dispute for fraud, the investigator never called me as promised, and instead, they closed the dispute without resolving the issue. This not only violated Wells Fargo's policies but also Nacha and federal regulations, including 15 U.S.C. 1693a (12), 15 U.S.C. 1693f (c), and 15 U.S.C. 1693g (b).

Despite bringing this issue to your attention, I have yet to receive any meaningful resolution or apology for the inconvenience caused by your staff's incompetence.

While I understand that mistakes can happen, the frequency and severity of these incidents on my account are unacceptable. As a loyal customer with a long history of banking with Wells Fargo, I expect better service and more importantly, respect for my time and money.

In light of this experience, I request that you take immediate action to address the following issues:

1. Re-open the dispute and investigate the fraudulent transactions on my account in a timely and thorough manner.
2. Provide a detailed explanation of how these incidents occurred and what measures Wells Fargo will take to prevent them from happening in the future.

4. Provide compensation for the $12,000 in fraudulent transactions that were processed on my account.

I hope that Wells Fargo will take these concerns seriously and work towards resolving them in a prompt and satisfactory manner. If not, I may have to seek legal action, which could result in treble damages as outlined in the federal regulations mentioned above.

"I am the primary on this card, I added my boyfriend as an auth user. We travel together. Sometimes he books and plans the trips, sometimes, I book and plan the trips. But we use the same card/account to earn the rewards. We both downloaded the app to better serve our booking needs. I noticed in XXXX that not only were we missing rewards points and credit for nights stayed in a hotel, but also, my total points and his were different. So I called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with someone about this. I provided confirmation numbers and dates for hotels that were missing. One hotel named, XXXX, is still in the transitioning phase, so she assured me that the rewards would be added once the hotel has completely switched over. After that call, I waited. On XX/XX/XXXX I opened a chat box with the card reward center to ask about the difference of reward points on his app versus mine and also about the XXXX stays. He again asked for all the confirmations etc, so I sent them again. He then explained that even though we have one account, and one bill, that we have separate rewards. So anything that he books or slides his card for, goes to a reward account under him, and the same for me. I explained to the gentleman that is not good practice, and its only one account, so the points earned and nights stayed should be merged. He said its impossible. So i ended the chat, and decided to call and speak to a live person. I then called in and spoke with a woman, went over everything again, she said the same, and said i should only use one of our cards moving forward, and that i can transfer his rewards to my account for a fee, but any credit for "" nights stayed '' would be lost.

Title: Disappointing Experience with Customer Service

Dear [Bank Name],

I recently had an unfortunate experience with your customer service, which left me feeling frustrated and disappointed. Despite my efforts to resolve the issue, I was met with incompetence and a lack of attention to detail.

Background:
On [date], I received a letter from your bank regarding an alert on one of my credit cards.

Dear [Bank Representative],

I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the recent service I received from Bank of America. Despite being a loyal customer for many years, I have encountered a series of unfortunate events that have left me feeling disorganized and ignored. My case ID is XXXX, submitted on XX/XX/2023, and I recently had a phone conversation with XXXX XXXX regarding the matter.

As you are aware, I called to inquire about an alert on my credit card, which was allegedly placed due to a change of address. However, after speaking with XXXX XXXX, I discovered that there must have been some confusion or miscommunication within the bank, as I had not attempted to use the card in question. To my surprise, XXXX XXXX acknowledged the mistake and promised to review the recorded calls.

Unfortunately, this sequence of events has left me feeling disillusioned with the level of service and professionalism exhibited by Bank of America's representatives. The time and effort I have invested in resolving this issue has been tremendous, and I find it appalling that such a simple matter could be handled so ineptly.

To address my concerns, I would like to request the following:

1. A thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the placement of the alert on my credit card. I believe a more diligent review process could have avoided this inconvenience and frustration.
2. A formal apology for the confusion, miscommunication, and any resulting inconvenience caused by Bank of America's representatives.
3. A commitment to improving the bank's customer service procedures to ensure that similar issues are addressed promptly and efficiently in the future.

In light of these concerns, I would like to request a case severity score of 1.0 and a tone severity score of 3.0 for this complaint. While my frustration is understandable, I hope you will appreciate that some decorum is still expected when communicating with the bank's representatives.

Title: Disappointing Experience with Bank of America

Dear Customer Service Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently had an unfortunate experience with Bank of America regarding a damaged goods claim. As a long-time customer of the bank, I was disappointed to encounter such poor service from their claims department.

Background:
I purchased some goods from a small business owner in LA, and upon receiving them, I noticed they were not properly sewn. I contacted the seller, who confirmed the issue and agreed to replace the items. However, when I submitted a claim to Bank of America for reimbursement, they denied the request due to the letter not being on official stationery. Despite the fact that the seller is a small business owner who puts all his money back into his business, Bank of America's rigid policy required the letter to be on custom-made stationery.

My Concerns:
I was shocked and frustrated by the bank's inflexible stance on this matter. As a customer, I expect some degree of empathy and understanding from my financial institution, especially when it comes to minority-owned businesses. The fact that Bank of America failed to see things from the seller's perspective and dismissed his claim without proper investigation is concerning.

Dear Wells Fargo Customer Service Team,

I'm writing to express my frustration with the unresolved debt issues I've been experiencing with Wells Fargo BObs Discount Furniture.

This has caused me a significant amount of stress and inconvenience, and I hope you can address this matter promptly.

The tone severity score is set at 3.0 because the language used in the complaint is mildly critical and expresses a sense of frustration, but without being confrontational or aggressive. The tone is polite and professional, which is appropriate for a customer service complaint.

Body of the Complaint:

I recently purchased a chair from Wells Fargo BObs Discount Furniture with special financing.

When I contacted customer service to inquire about the applicable amount needed to pay off the debt, the representative provided me with the information and I made the payment as instructed.

Firstly, the agent who called me, XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX, was very aggressive and made me feel nervous. He instructed me to send money to two different locations, which I found unreasonable and concerning. I understand the need to track the fraudulent activity, but the way he went about it was not helpful or reassuring.

Chase then turned around and charged me an overdraft fee of {$34.00} each for all three of those charges.

I cant afford that. Its ridiculous how predatory these banks are. I am currently in the process of switching to a bank that does not have overdraft fees because I cant afford being charged an overdraft fee for a charge you knew I didnt not have the funds for in the first place.

Dear Chase Bank,

I am writing to express my frustration with the recent overdraft fees I incurred on my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, my account had a negative balance, causing an overdraft fee. Instead of declining further automated charges, your bank allowed them to process, resulting in my account falling into a lower negative balance. This led to three additional overdraft fees, totaling {$34.00} each. While I understand the importance of covering these transactions, I cannot afford the combined total of over $200 in fees.

I believe that a more customer-centric approach could have been taken to address this issue. Perhaps there could have been a warning or notification system in place to alert me when my account was approaching negative territory? Or, better yet, Chase could have simply covered the charges itself, rather than charging me for doing so.

I understand that overdraft fees are a source of revenue for banks, but I believe it is important to balance these needs with the financial well-being of your customers. As it stands, I am currently in the process of switching to a bank that does not charge such exorbitant fees for overdrafts.

I hope you will take my feedback into consideration and make some changes to your policies moving forward. Thank you for your time and attention.

"I initiated a balance transfer with Chase on XX/XX/23 of {$5000.00} for a 12 month promotional 0 % interest. I did this online. 

I received my XXXX bill with interest, so called in to make sure the promotion was in effect. I was told it was, but due to the terms of the balance transfer interest was charged on new purchases from the date of purchase instead of a traditional billing cycle. I said I was not told this, and they explained the agent had to go over these disclosures on the phone before allowing it to go through. It took two explanations from myself that it was not done with an agent but online before she said that I still acknowledged this would happen. 

I humbly admitted I'm sure did not read XXXX & XXXX 's of something like this before hitting "" Accept ''. I asked to be emailed a copy of what I signed. It was stated that it could not be provided. 

Now, at this point I decided would just use another card for regular purchases to completely avoid this in its entirety. However, tracking down the all the pieces the card was tied to was problematic. But when charges came through, I made immediate payments to clear those charges to ensure no interest would be charged. 

However, I am now learning that Chase has been applying my payments with significantly higher priority to my brand-new 0 % balance transfer instead of the purchases that I had made that would be accruing interest. In addition, you are not able to see how your payments are applied in this fashion until your next statement when that interest has already been accrued. 

For my XXXX payment of {$2300.00} to clear all non-balance transfer charges, {$500.00} of that was used towards the 0 % balance. This is clearly in an effort to force the consumer to pay interest on their purchase. At a XXXX, {$450.00} would be the needed amount paid by month to have a this {$5000.00} transfer paid off in the 11 months by its due date.

Dear Chase Customer Service Team,

I recently had a less than satisfactory experience with your bank when I initiated a balance transfer online on XX/XX/23 for a promotional 0% interest for 12 months. While I understood the terms of the promotion, I was not pleased with how some aspects were communicated to me during the process.

I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the recent events surrounding my bank account. On Monday, I discovered that my account had been closed completely without any explanation from the bank. This was a shock to me, as I had been in good standing with the bank for many years and had never experienced any issues with my account.

I have since learned that the reason for the closure of my account is due to a fraudulent check issued by a third party. It appears that someone accessed my account information and issued a check in my name without my knowledge or consent. This is completely unacceptable, and I demand that Wells Fargo takes immediate action to rectify this situation.

I request that you refund the amount of the fraudulent check and restore my bank account to its active status as soon as possible. I also expect a full investigation into how this happened and measures taken to prevent such incidents in the future.

As a long-time customer of Wells Fargo, I am deeply disappointed in the carelessness and lack of attention to detail that led to this situation. I expect better from one of the largest and most reputable financial institutions in the country.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to a resolution as soon as possible. Please inform me of any further steps required on my part to resolve this issue.

I immediately got the notification & immediately logged into my XXXX XXXX Account, that has my Bank Of America account linked, to transfer the full {$1000.00}. It landed in my XXXX XXXX Credit Card instead of my checking account, because it was said that when I transfer from their end instead of Bank of America it can't go directly to my credit card. I contacted XXXX XXXX Credit Card customer service the next day when I noticed that issue. When I called XXXX XXXX, to request them to get understanding and then to request that they send the {$1000.00} to my checking account as it was intended to go to from the beginning, they said sure but they had to call Bank of America on three way to verify the funds were clear. We made the call, and on XX/XX/2023 the very next day Bank of America confirmed with XXXX XXXX that the funds were cleared as the day before, XX/XX/2023. XX/XX/2023, Bank of America was still using the {$1000.00} that was cleared XX/XX/2023, that I transferred on XX/XX/2023 immediately and the {$1000.00} showed up on my XXXX XXXX Credit Card same day right away. XX/XX/2023 Bank of America send an email ( that I didn't see until days later after seeing XXXX subtracted {$1000.00} from my account ) saying I didn't have enough money in my account. XX/XX/2023 XXXX XXXX sent a notification saying the "" funds transfer has been returned to XXXX XXXX '' from Bank of America to XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$1000.00} and said return reason was "" Insufficient Funds. '' We called on three way to try and handle the situation, Bank of America said I could add XXXX XXXX to the account so that I could transfer the money back to them, I tried to do it while they were on the phone and it said that I couldn't link the account both times that I tried although I've transferred before. So I took {$960.00} out of my Bank of America while on the phone and put it on my XXXX card, leaving {$39.00} in my Bank of America account and waiting until it cleared so that I could withdraw what was left and close the account. I then transferred that money immediately to my XXXX XXXX Checking ( I already had money in that account ). All this to say, Bank of America was double dipping in that money, causing XXXX XXXX to charge me an extra {$1000.00} on my credit card which also made my credit card balance be maxed out messing up my credit when I just got my credit to go up a lot of points, and because the "" changed their mind '' about my funds being cleared a day before and decided to hold on to those funds. The {$1000.00} was reversed from my checking and credit card. Also, I made a cash deposit into Bank of America in the amount of {$130.00} and immediately withdrew {$120.00} the same day. Bank of America has on my statement that I deposited {$130.00} on XX/XX/2023 and withdrew {$120.00} on XX/XX/2023, how is any of that even possible.

Dear Bank of America Customer Service Team,
I recently experienced some difficulties with my bank account that I wanted to bring to your attention. On XX/XX/2023, I transferred $1000 from my Bank of America account to my checking account via a payment from my employer. However, the transfer was declined due to insufficient funds, and the money was returned to the sender.
I attempted to add additional funds to my account by transferring $960 from another bank account, but I was unable to link the two accounts despite having transferred before. Therefore, I withdrew $39 from my Bank of America account and immediately deposited it into my checking account using a cash deposit.
Unfortunately, the transaction date on my statement shows that I made a $130 deposit on XX/XX/2023 and withdrew $120 on the same day. This is incorrect information, as I only made a single deposit of $960 on the day in question.
I understand that this may have caused inconvenience for you, but I am requesting a refund for the $1000 that was returned due to insufficient funds. Additionally, I would like you to correct the transaction dates on my statement to accurately reflect the only deposit that I made.
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and hope that we can resolve it as soon as possible. Sincerely,

Title: Unauthorized Transactions on My Wells Fargo Account

Dear Wells Fargo Customer Service,

I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration regarding the unauthorized transactions on my account. On XX/XX/23, I visited a repair shop and left my phone there. Upon retrieving it, I noticed several unusual transactions had been made without my knowledge or consent. Specifically, there were six charges for $500 each, three charges for $200 each, and one charge for $180.

I immediately contacted the bank upon discovering these irregularities, and I was informed that a temporary credit would be applied to my account. However, despite multiple attempts to follow up on this matter, I never received the promised credit. Instead, I only received an automated email 10 business days later. When I finally decided to reach out again, I was told that the bank had determined that no fraud occurred and denied my case.

As a customer of Wells Fargo, I find it unacceptable that my issue has been handled in such a dismissive manner. The fact that I was never contacted directly after filing my complaint and that my case was unfairly denied without proper investigation is particularly concerning. Under federal law, I have only two business days to notify the bank of any unauthorized transactions, yet it seems that Wells Fargo has failed to meet its obligations in this regard.

On [date], I visited a local shop to repair my phone and left my card and other personal information inside. When I retrieved my phone, I noticed several unauthorized transactions had been made on my Wells Fargo account. The amounts were $500, $200, and $180 respectively, posted on [date].

I immediately contacted your customer service department to report the incident and request assistance. However, despite being told I would receive a temporary credit, I never received it. Moreover, I was assured that someone would contact me within 10 business days, but I only received an automated email. This lack of communication and follow-up has left me feeling disillusioned with your bank's customer service.

As a long-time customer of Wells Fargo, I expect more from your institution. Under federal law, I have the right to contact you within two business days to dispute any unauthorized transactions. To date, I have not received any resolution or explanation for these fraudulent activities on my account. Your bank's inability to provide adequate customer service and protect my financial security has caused significant inconvenience and stress.

I request that your team thoroughly investigate this matter, provide a satisfactory resolution, and take measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and assurance that my account will be secured.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

"Below is a summary letter and request I delivered to Chase. At the Chase branch, around XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I was placed on a call with a back office operations representative named XXXX who stated he could not tell me the status of the amendment or recall and that it could take 8 business days for Chase to review ( as opposed to the 24-48 hours a prior rep had stated. ) I requested an escalation point and he refused. I requested contact information to submit a complaint and he said he was it ( and when I said there should be another contact, like an ethics line, he refused to provide it. ) I asked if there was a way for me to obtain a copy of the recorded call that were were on and he said no. I asked if he could provide contact information for me to provide a formal notice to Chase and that was also denied. 

Re : Wire Transfer XXXX To whom it may concern : I initiated a wire transfer XX/XX/2023, from my XXXX account to a Chase account. Later the same day, I realized that I had transposed 2 digits on the intended recipients account number and immediately contacted XXXX via phone and secure message center. I am seeking a status update on the wire amendment and recall mentioned below and clarification on Chases process for handling these issues and the expected timeline to resolution. I also request Chase examine how this wire transfer was completed when the full name and account number ( with business name noted in the wire ) could not have matched the unintended recipients name, business name, and account number, and explain how wire transfers complete in violation of your policy ( per the Chase representatives statement below ) are addressed. 

By way of background, On XX/XX/2023, the following took place : I called XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX advised they could issue an amendment to rectify the issue. XXXX issued an amendment to the wire transfer at XXXX XXXX  XXXX suggested I reach out to Chase and notify Chase of the issue. 
I called Chase and spoke to a representative at XXXX XXXX XXXX. This Chase representative explained that if the information on the wire transfer did not match, the wire would be rejected. She stated it is Chases policy to verify that the name and account numbers match and to reject the wire if there is an error. In this case, the name of the intended recipient would not match the name of the unintended recipient. 

On XX/XX/2023, the following took place : I called XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX for an update. XXXX advised me that they had not received any communication or update from Chase and suggested that I reach out to Chase directly. 
I called Chase at XXXX AM EST and was informed Chase will not provide me any information about the wire because I am not the intended or unintended recipient. 
I reached out to the intended recipient, XXXX XXXX, and requested she contact Chase for an update. XXXX contacted Chase.

Chase informed XXXX that the wire had already been deposited into an unintended recipients account despite the wire information not matching. Chase does not provide her with any recourse. 
I call XXXX again to convey what Chase told XXXX and check the status of the amendment. XXXX informs me there is no update from Chase. 

Today, XX/XX/2023, the following took place : I called XXXX at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX for a status update. This XXXX representative issues a recall at XXXX XXXX based on yesterdays developments. 
I called Chase at XXXXXXXX XXXX informing Chase of the recall and asking for a status update. I am again told Chase will not provide me any information. 
XXXX called Chase and was not provided an update. 

I respectfully request the information noted in my first paragraph. Please note that I am not requesting the personal information of the unintended recipient or of XXXX XXXX, the intended recipient. I can be reached via telephone at XXXX or via email at XXXX. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX",3,3,3.0,2.0,"Subject: Urgent Request for Wire Transfer Amendment and Clarification

Dear Chase Customer Service Team,

I am writing to request an update on the wire transfer amendment and clarification regarding Chase's process for handling these issues. On XX/XX/2023, I initiated a wire transfer from my account to a Chase account, but due to a transposed digit, I immediately contacted Chase via phone and secure message center to inform them of the mistake.

Unfortunately, during my conversation with a representative named XXXX, I encountered frustrating obstacles in obtaining the information and resolution I require. Here's a summary of what occurred:

1. On XX/XX/2023, at approximately XXXX AM EST, I called Chase Customer Service to report an error in my wire transfer details. In this call, I was advised that if the name or account number on the wire transfer did not match the recipient's information in Chase's system, the transfer would be rejected. (Case severity = 3.0)
2. While speaking with XXXX, a representative from Chase, I was informed that the issue could be corrected via an amendment to the wire transfer. However, XXXX suggested that I reach out to Chase directly for this process. (Tone severity = 3.0)
3. When I contacted Chase again on XX/XX/2023 at approximately XXXX AM EST, I was informed by a representative named XXXX that the wire transfer had already been deposited into an unintended recipient's account, despite the information not matching. Chase indicated they could not provide any recourse in this situation, and the matter would need to be handled between the parties involved. (Case severity = 2.0)
4. I then reached out to the intended recipient, XXXX XXXX, who confirmed that they had also been contacted by Chase regarding this issue. (Tone severity = 3.0)
5. On XX/XX/2023, at approximately XXXX AM EST, I called Chase again to inquire about the status of the amendment and any potential recourse for the unintended recipient's account. Unfortunately, I was met with resistance when attempting to obtain this information, as Chase refused to provide me with updates or assistance. (Case severity = 2.0)
6. Finally, on XX/XX/2023 at approximately XXXX AM EST, XXXX called Chase to request a recall of the wire transfer due to the error and lack of communication from Chase regarding this matter. I was once again informed that no assistance or updates were available through Chase's customer service channels. (Tone severity = 3.0)

Based on these interactions, I kindly request the following information:

1. An explanation of Chase's process for handling wire transfer amendments in situations where the recipient name or account number does not match the information on file with Chase. (Case severity = 2.0)
2. Clarification regarding the circumstances under which Chase will provide updates or assistance to parties affected by these errors, such as the unintended recipient in this case. (Tone severity = 3.0)
3. A summary of any steps I can take to resolve this matter and prevent similar issues in the future, including any necessary documentation or forms that may need to be completed. (Case severity = 2.0)

I understand that these events have caused frustration and inconvenience for all parties involved, and I appreciate your attention to this matter. I can be reached at XXXX or via email at XXXX for any further communication or updates. Thank you in advance for your assistance in resolving this situation. (Tone severity = 3.0)

Dear Chase Customer Service Team,

I am writing to follow up on my wire transfer initiated on XX/XX/2023, which was intended for a specific account holder but mistakenly deposited into an unintended recipient's account due to a minor error in the account number. I have been attempting to obtain an update on the status of the amendment and recall process since then, but my efforts have been met with frustration and disappointment.

As a valued customer, I expect timely and efficient service from Chase. However, my recent experiences have fallen short of these expectations. During my most recent calls to Chase, I was informed that the bank will not provide me with any information regarding the wire transfer or the unintended recipient's account, citing privacy concerns and policy restrictions.

I understand and respect the need for protecting sensitive customer information, but in this case, I only seek a small update on the status of the amendment process. As the intended recipient's name does not match the unintended recipient's name, it is crucial to verify that the correct account holder received the wire transfer. I kindly request that Chase provide me with an update on the progress or any available next steps for resolving this matter.

In light of these developments, I kindly request that you escalate this issue to a higher severity level, so it can receive proper attention and resolution. As a long-time customer, I appreciate your dedication to addressing my concerns and providing excellent service. However, the persistent lack of progress in resolving this matter has resulted in significant inconvenience and frustration.

I would be grateful if you could adjust the tone of your responses to prioritize clarity, empathy, and customer-focused solutions. Your assistance in addressing this issue promptly would be greatly appreciated, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Case Severity Score: 2.0

The issue at hand is significant enough to warrant attention, but it does not have a dire impact on my overall experience with the bank.

Body:

I recently purchased a vehicle through XXXX, and a third-party loan check was issued on my behalf from Wells Fargo. However, the check contained incorrect information regarding the purchase, specifically the make and model of the vehicle. I brought this to the attention of your customer service representatives, but they were unable or unwilling to assist me in rectifying the issue. Instead, they informed me that the check had been cashed by Wells Fargo and could not be reversed.

I have attached a copy of the cashed check and the vehicle purchase agreement to this email, as I find it difficult to believe that your bank would intentionally issue a check with incorrect information without proper verification. I request that you take immediate action to rectify this situation and return the funds to the appropriate account.

Conclusion:

While the issue at hand is significant enough to warrant attention, I do not believe it has had a severe impact on my overall experience with Wells Fargo. However, I do feel that your bank's handling of the situation has been unacceptable, and I hope that you will take immediate action to rectify the issue and restore my faith in your institution.

Dear Wells Fargo Customer Service,

I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with my recent experience refinancing a conventional loan through your institution. Despite my best efforts to work with you, I was met with fraudulent denials and ultimately lost my home. I cannot stress enough how upsetting it is to feel that Wells Fargo preyed upon me during this difficult time, taking advantage of my situation for their own benefit.

I refinanced a conventional loan in XXXX with Wells Fargo and had no issues until I tried to refinance again in XXXX. To my dismay, the refinancing was denied, and I was forced to short-sale my home. It is unacceptable that your institution would take advantage of vulnerable customers during a housing crisis, denying them the opportunity to keep their homes.

I am particularly distressed by the fact that Wells Fargo should have approved my refinancing, yet they fraudulently denied it. This not only caused me significant financial strain but also led to the loss of my home. I cannot help but wonder how many other customers have faced similar situations, with your institution taking advantage of their vulnerability for profit.

I urge you to take immediate action to address these issues and ensure that customers are treated fairly and with respect. It is crucial that Wells Fargo implements stricter guidelines to prevent fraudulent denials and protect the homes of its customers. I hope that by sharing my experience, others will not have to go through what I did, and your institution can regain the trust of its clients.

Dear Wells Fargo Customer Service,

In XXXX, I had a conventional loan with Wells Fargo and attempted to refinance it in XXXX. Unfortunately, my application was denied, and as a result, I was forced to short-sale my home. I feel that Wells Fargo's actions were not only unprofessional but also illegal, as they preyed upon me during a vulnerable time and fraudulently denied my refinancing.

I understand that financial institutions must abide by strict guidelines when approving loan applications. However, I believe that Wells Fargo's denial of my refinancing was not justified, given my excellent credit history and sufficient income to service the new loan. It seems that they deliberately sought to profit from my misfortune rather than assisting me in finding a solution that would have been mutually beneficial.

As a result of Wells Fargo's actions, I was forced to go through an emotionally distressing process, including the loss of my home. This is unacceptable and reflects poorly on your institution's commitment to customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Subject: Urgent Assistance Required with Wells Fargo Mortgage

Dear [Name of Bank Customer Service Representative],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an urgent situation regarding my mortgage with Wells Fargo, which is set to close on [date of closing]. My fiancé and I are in a precarious position due to an incorrect contract issued by one of your employees. This oversight has caused significant inconvenience and financial hardship for us, and we are counting on your prompt resolution to avoid any further complications.

Here's the background:

1. We transferred $ [amount] of assets to Wells Fargo to receive the Relationship Discount.
2. A Wells Fargo employee issued incorrect contracts, calculating the interest without applying the Relationship Discount.
3. My fiancé signed these documents in good faith, believing them to be accurate.
4. I have not yet signed the documents, as I was waiting for confirmation from Wells Fargo that the issue would be resolved.

Unfortunately, our mortgage broker has informed us that Wells Fargo is reneging on their agreement and refusing to honor the Relationship Discount. They are taking an unreasonable stance that since one party has signed the contract, it must be considered final and cannot be changed without starting the process again from scratch.

Dear [Bank Name Customer Service],

I am writing to seek your immediate assistance in resolving a critical issue with our mortgage application at Wells Fargo. My fiancé and I are set to close on our first home purchase on [Date], but we are currently facing an unexpected obstacle that could result in significant financial loss if left unresolved.

Context:
We transferred $ [amount] of assets to Wells Fargo to qualify for the Relationship Discount on our mortgage. However, a Wells Fargo employee issued incorrect contracts, calculating the interest without applying the Relationship Discount. My fiancé signed these documents in good faith, believing them to be accurate.

Current Situation:
Our mortgage broker has informed us that Wells Fargo is now reneging on their offer of the Relationship Discount, claiming that because one party (my fiancé) has signed the agreement, we must start the process again from scratch. This would result in a $ [amount] financial burden over the 30-year mortgage term.

Concerns:
We are shocked and frustrated by Wells Fargo's unjustified position, which not only jeopardizes our home purchase but also violates the trust we placed in their team. We urgently need your intervention to resolve this matter before it escalates further.

Tone Severity: 3.0 (Harsh)

Event Severity: 2.0 (Significant Impact)

I expect a prompt resolution to this issue, as any delay could compromise our ability to finalize the mortgage and complete our home purchase. I hope you understand the gravity of the situation and will take immediate action to address our concerns.

Dear Bank of America Prepaid Card Customer Service Team,

I am writing to bring to your attention a series of unauthorized charges on my prepaid card, which has resulted in significant financial loss and compromised my personal information. I request immediate action to address this issue and prevent any further misconduct.

These charges are not only unauthorized but also inconsistent with any legitimate transactions I have made.

As a long-standing customer of Bank of America and an avid user of their prepaid services, I expect nothing less than full transparency and accountability from your organization regarding this security breach.

Description of Event:
Over the past three months, I have encountered problems with payment processing on my account.

"Wells Fargo claims i missed a payment in XX/XX/2020. They then proceeded to charge me late fees for 3 years because they counted the payments I was making at a month late instead of contacting me about the missed payment. They claimed to have called me, and provided me with a phone record. The phone number listed on the log is the company I am employed at. The team that answers the phone calls is under my supervision. No one at my work received a call looking for me. Not only am I on the company directory where they could have reached me, but the phone rings at my desk when an outside call is made.

I was at work for nearly all of the times listed answering the phone at the number provided. If they would have asked if I was available to anyone at the company, I could have been reached. 
They also said that they were not authorized to call my cell phone despite it being listed as my home phone on the loan application ( which I am providing. ) They could not provide me with information telling me how I could have known or authorized the number that I put on my loan application. They provided this as evidence that I was contacted.

Dear [Bank's Customer Service Team],

I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with Wells Fargo's handling of my loan payments. Despite providing the necessary information to prove that I was not contacted via phone, the bank continues to charge me late fees for missed payments.

Event Severity: 2.0 (Mild Impact on Customer Experience)

The event severity score is based on the impact of the issue on my overall experience with Wells Fargo. While missing a payment and being charged late fees for three years can be frustrating, it has not had a significant impact on my relationship with the bank. I have not experienced any major disruptions in service, and I am still able to conduct my financial transactions smoothly.

The tone severity score reflects the level of criticism or harshness in the complaint. While I am unhappy with Wells Fargo's actions, I avoid using confrontational language and instead focus on expressing my disappointment and frustration in a constructive manner.

Body:

I recently discovered that Wells Fargo charged me late fees for three years after missing a payment in [date]. When I reviewed the phone records provided by the bank, I realized that no one from Wells Fargo actually contacted me despite their claims. As the person responsible for answering the phone at my workplace, I find it hard to believe that they could not reach me through the company directory or by ringing through to my desk directly.

I understand that mistakes can happen, but I'm disappointed in Wells Fargo's lack of due diligence in verifying the contact information they used to try to reach me. It's unacceptable that they would claim to have called me when there is no record of such a call. I expect better communication and transparency from my bank, especially when it comes to important matters like loan payments.

I kindly request that Wells Fargo reviews this matter and takes appropriate action to correct their mistake. I would appreciate it if you could waive the late fees charged to my account, as I did not receive any notice of missed payments or penalties until now. Please confirm in writing once the issue has been resolved.

Title: Unauthorized Late Fees Charged Despite Evidence of Payments

To Whom It May Concern at Wells Fargo,

I am writing to express my frustration and disappointment with the way I was treated by your bank. In XX/XX/2020, I missed a payment on a loan I have with you, and instead of reaching out to me directly to resolve the issue, you chose to charge me late fees for three years without proper communication or follow-up.

I find it difficult to understand how your bank could claim that they contacted me through phone calls when there is clear evidence that they did not reach me at my workplace. The phone number provided on my loan application is my personal home phone, and I have no reason to believe that it was not authorized to receive calls regarding the loan. Your lack of diligence in verifying this crucial detail has led to a significant financial burden for me, and I am seriously disappointed in your bank's customer service.

I understand that mistakes can happen, but the way your bank handled this situation is unacceptable. Not only did they fail to contact me directly, but they also failed to provide any written notification of my late payments via mail, despite sending notifications for shorter payments. This lack of communication and follow-up has caused me a great deal of stress and inconvenience, and I hope that you will take immediate action to rectify the situation.

I kindly request that you review this matter and take appropriate action to correct the late fees that were charged to my account. I also expect a full explanation for why your bank failed to follow proper protocols in contacting me and verifying my personal information. I hope that you will prioritize customer satisfaction and take steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

Dear [Bank's Customer Service Team],

I am writing to bring to your attention a pressing issue regarding unauthorized charges on my credit card account with [Bank Name]. As a long-time customer, I expect timely and effective resolution of this matter.

Case Severity: 2 (Mild Impact)

The unauthorized charges on my credit card account are a significant issue that has caused inconvenience and financial loss. However, the impact is not severe enough to warrant a higher severity score. The charges were made without my authorization, and I have already reported them to the bank multiple times. While there has been a lack of response or resolution from the bank's customer service team, I still believe that this issue can be addressed with a moderate level of effort.

Tone Severity: 3 (Moderately Harsh)

I am frustrated and disappointed with the bank's handling of this matter. The lack of communication and resolution has caused me to feel disrespected and ignored as a customer. While I recognize that mistakes can happen, it is essential that the bank takes prompt action to address these issues and prevent them from happening in the future. A more proactive approach is required to resolve this situation satisfactorily.

Complaint:

I recently noticed unauthorized charges on my credit card account, which were not made by me. I immediately contacted the bank's customer service team via email on [Date] and received a response stating that there was no balance on the account and it was in good standing with no errors. However, upon further investigation, the bank informed me that they over-refunded me and I owe them money. This is completely unacceptable, and I refuse to pay any unauthorized charges made without my authorization.

I have attached documentation to support my claims, including screenshots of my emails to the bank and their responses. It is evident that there has been a lack of communication and coordination within the bank's customer service team, leading to this situation. I request that you take immediate action to resolve this matter and ensure that it does not happen again in the future.

Resolution Request:

I request that the bank takes the following steps to resolve this issue:

1. Closure of my credit card account due to unauthorized charges made without my authorization.
2. Refund of any unauthorized charges made on my account.
3. Implementation of additional measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to a satisfactory resolution. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Subject: Unauthorized Charges on My Credit Card Account

Dear [Bank's Customer Service Team],

I am writing to bring to your attention some inconvenient and frustrating experiences I have had with my credit card account recently. Specifically, there were unauthorized charges on my account that were not made by me. Despite my repeated attempts to contact the bank and resolve this issue, I have received no resolution or communication from the bank.

I first noticed the unauthorized charges on [date] and immediately reached out to the bank via email on [date]. However, I did not receive any response until [date], where the bank claimed that there was no balance on my account and that my account was in good standing with no errors. This information was contradictory to what I had already discovered and communicated to the bank via email.

I have attached documentation showing my efforts to contact the bank and resolve this issue since [date]. These emails demonstrate a lack of response and communication from the bank, despite my repeated attempts to reach out. The bank's statements that there was no balance on my account and no errors were incorrect, as shown in the attached documents.

As a result of these unresolved issues, I am now left with unauthorized charges on my credit card account. While I understand that mistakes can happen, the lack of communication and resolution from the bank has been frustrating and inconvenient for me. I have paid off the balance of my credit card, but I would like to request that the bank close my account due to their errors.

I hope you will take this complaint seriously and work to resolve it as soon as possible. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to hearing from you soon.

"On XX/XX/XXXX my card was compromised and someone charged {$6400.00} to my card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, citibank did the right thing and completely credited my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, citibank ( or maybe the merchant ) did {$2100.00} of chargebacks back onto my card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, citibank did the right thing and completely credited my account, although this time they actually credited {$5.00} too much. 

Here is where the unresolved dispute begins : XX/XX/XXXX, citibank ( or maybe the merchant ) did {$2500.00} of chargebacks back onto my card. This was made of up 4 charges : {$1000.00}, {$930.00}, {$620.00}, {$23.00} XX/XX/XXXX, citibank ( or maybe the merchant ) did ANOTHER {$1000.00} chargeback onto my card. 

XX/XX/XXXX, citibank credited me for 2 of the chargebacks from XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} and {$930.00} XX/XX/XXXX, 3 random credits were applied to my account, ( I was told this was done by the merchant ) : {$5.00}, {$20.00}, {$20.00} XX/XX/XXXX, citibank credited me for the last XXXX chargebacks from XX/XX/XXXX : {$620.00}, {$23.00} They still owe me a credit for the {$1000.00} chargeback that was charged to my balance on XX/XX/XXXX. When you net this against the 4 random credits they have given me that have no offsetting charge ( totaling {$50.00} ) and combine that with 4 months of interest charges charged to me for short paying these fraudulent charges, it equals to my current balance which is {$1300.00}, none of which I actually owe to citibank. 

I have attached a spreadsheet that I've made which shows all of this charted out over time. Specifically, please take a look at the tab called "" charges vs credits '' and also the tab called "" sequential activity '' shows all of the charges in XXXX place with a running total on column XXXX I have also attached all of my credit card statements beginning with my XXXX statement when the initial problem started, all the was through my latest XXXX statement. 

On my personal spreadsheet that I have attached below, If you look at the tab called "" communication '', it details what I've been through with trying to work this out with citibank. Basically, it is the following cycle : - I call and explain the problem. The rep looks at my account and says that I've been given all the credits that I am due. I ask them to transfer me to their supervisor. 
- Supervisor comes on and either sees the problem and agrees to get this fixed, or in the last case, tries to tell me that the charges on my XXXX and XXXX statement were informational and did not actually go into my balance. A quick and simple mathematical calculation proves that to be untrue, in any case, they then transfer me back to customer service so they can actually credit the account. 
- Customer Service comes on and after explaining the problem again, they see the mistake but then they tell me that they don't have the authorization to make the credit, they will show this to their supervisor and the call ends. 
- Supervisor comes and takes a quick preliminary look at the account, decides that I've been credited everything that I am due, and closes the case. 

I have called and reopened the case many, many times. I am lost as to what to do. The last person I spoke with told me that they see the problem, and that I will be getting a letter showing that I have a {$1000.00} credit coming. That was 3 days ago and I haven't heard anything nor has my account been credited. 

My current balance due is made up of the following XXXX charges : {$1000.00} charged XX/XX/XXXX < $ XXXX credited XX/XX/XXXX < $ XXXX credited XX/XX/XXXX < $ XXXX credited XX/XX/XXXX < $ XXXX credited XX/XX/XXXX {$110.00} XX/XX/XXXX statement interest charge {$140.00} XX/XX/XXXX statement interest charge {$94.00} XX/XX/XXXX statement interest charge {$31.00} XX/XX/XXXX statement interest charge TOTAL : {$1300.00} I have emailed this breakdown to citibank on multiple occasions.",3,3,9.0,8.0,"Subject: Escalation of Credit Card Dispute with Citibank

Dear Citibank Customer Service Team,

I am writing this complaint as a last resort after multiple unsuccessful attempts to resolve my credit card dispute with your bank. My balance is currently inflated by incorrectly processed charges, and I have attached detailed documentation to prove my claims. I kindly request that you escalate this matter to a case severity of 2.0 and tone severity of 3.0, as it has caused significant inconvenience and financial hardship for me.

Background:
From XX/XX/XXXX to present date, I have been dealing with fraudulent charges on my credit card account. Despite numerous attempts to resolve the issue through customer service channels, the problem persists. My current balance is inflated by {$1300.00} due to unauthorized transactions that should be reversed. I have provided detailed breakdowns of these charges and credits in my attachments.

Issue:
The issue at hand is the failure of Citibank's customer service representatives to correctly process credits for fraudulent charges, resulting in an inflated balance. Despite following the proper channels to resolve this matter, I have been met with resistance and inconsistent communication from your team.

Request:
I respectfully request that you take immediate action to correct my credit card account and rectify the situation as follows:

1. Credit my account for all unauthorized charges totaling {$1300.00}.
2. Provide a written explanation of why these credits were not applied earlier, despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue.
3. Ensure that this matter is escalated to a supervisor or higher authority for review and resolution.
4. Offer compensation for any additional inconvenience or financial hardship caused by Citibank's inaction.

Consequences of Inaction:
Continuing to neglect my dispute will result in further damage to my credit score, as well as increased stress and frustration from dealing with an overwhelmed customer service team. I would appreciate prompt resolution to this matter, as it has already been ongoing for several months.

I am writing to escalate my concern regarding the incorrect charges applied to my credit card account. After numerous calls and messages with customer service representatives, I have been unable to resolve this issue. Despite their promises of credits and resolutions, my account remains uncredited, and I am left feeling frustrated and helpless.

As you can see from the attached spreadsheet, the charges on my account are not accurate. A detailed breakdown of the charges and credits is provided in the ""Charges vs Credits"" tab. The sequential activity tab shows all the transactions associated with these charges. My current balance due is a result of these errors, which I have been attempting to resolve for quite some time.

I understand that mistakes can happen, but the persistent nature of this issue and the lack of resolution is unacceptable. As a valued customer, I expect timely and effective solutions from Citibank. However, instead, I have encountered a cycle of transfers between representatives, each promising to resolve the issue but ultimately failing to do so.

I kindly request that you review my account and take immediate action to correct these errors. A credit for $1000.00, as promised, would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide a detailed explanation of why these charges were applied in the first place and how they will prevent such errors from occurring in the future.

I understand that this issue has been ongoing for some time, but I hope that with your attention and resolution, we can put this matter to rest. I am confident that with your assistance, we can work together to find a satisfactory solution.

Despite being told that it would take up to four business days for my request to be processed, I have been left waiting for seven business days without any updates or communication from your representatives.

When I tried to escalate the issue further by speaking with a supervisor directly, I was met with a lack of responsiveness and follow-up.

Despite my patience and politeness, she seemed annoyed and reluctant to assist me.

I understand that bank employees have a lot on their plates, but it's crucial they handle customer interactions with empathy and professionalism. In this case, the teller's behavior fell short of my expectations, and I did not feel valued as a customer.

After expressing my disappointment to the teller, she informed me that Wells Fargo no longer offers ATM card renewals at their branches. Instead, customers must use an online platform or mobile app to request a new card. While I appreciate the convenience of these options, it's unfortunate that there was no clear communication about this policy change when I visited the branch.

I also noticed that there were only four tellers present at the branch, with no other employees visible. Given the size of the branch and the number of customers present, it seemed inefficient to have such a small staff-to-customer ratio. It would be beneficial to provide more personnel to ensure a smoother and faster experience for customers.

In light of this situation, I kindly request that you investigate my complaint and take appropriate action to address the following issues:

1. Provide clear communication regarding ATM card renewals at Wells Fargo branches.
2. Ensure that branch staff handle customer interactions with empathy, professionalism, and friendliness.
3. Increase the number of tellers at each branch to improve efficiency and customer experience.

I hope you will take my concerns seriously and work towards resolving them. I would appreciate a prompt response regarding any actions taken to address these issues. Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely,

I recently visited a Wells Fargo branch in XXXX, CA to renew my expired ATM card. However, I encountered an unexpected issue during the process. The branch manager claimed that he couldn't order a new ATM card for me on his computer, which surprised and confused me. After verifying with the teller employee, I found out that I could have ordered it by phone or online without visiting the branch in person.

I am writing to express my disappointment regarding this situation and request your assistance in resolving the issue. As a long-time customer of Wells Fargo, I expect a higher level of service from the bank's representatives. It is unacceptable that an employee at the branch failed to provide accurate information about their available services or refer me to the appropriate department for help.

I would appreciate it if you could escalate this complaint to a manager with more authority and responsibility to address my concerns. I hope that Wells Fargo can take immediate action to correct this situation, which has left me feeling frustrated and unvalued as a customer. Your prompt attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
[Your name]",2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0
